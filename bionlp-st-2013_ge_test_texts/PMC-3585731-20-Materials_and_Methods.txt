Western Blot
For Western blot, 4x105 adherent cells (1x106 Jurkat cells) were seeded into 35 mm2 dishes. After 24-48 hr, cells were stimulated with 30 microM zVAD.fmk or 10 ng/ml mouse TNFalpha. For treatments under serum free conditions, cells were serum starved for 24 hr prior to the addition of growth factors, 20 microM zVAD.fmk or 10 ng/ml mouse TNFalpha. Cells were harvested in 1xRIPA buffer (Cell Signaling) supplemented with 50 microg/ml phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride. After brief sonication, cell lysates were spun down for 15 min at 14,000xrpm. Protein concentrations were measured using the Pierce 660 nm Assay Reagent (Pierce). Equal amounts of proteins were boiled for 5 min at 95degreesC. Western blotting was performed according to standard protocols. Briefly, SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to PVDF membrane, blocked in 3% milk or 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies were incubated in 5%BSA/TBST overnight at 4degreesC. Secondary antibodies were incubated in TBST for 30 min at room temperature. Luminata (Millipore) ECL reagents were used to develop the signals. In some cases, membranes were stripped using OneMinute stripping buffer (GM Biosciences) and reprobed with new antibodies.
