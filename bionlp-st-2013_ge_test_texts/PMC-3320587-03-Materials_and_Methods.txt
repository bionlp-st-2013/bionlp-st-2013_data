Cell culture
PBMC from normal unidentified donors were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia Corporation, Peapack, NJ) density gradient centrifugation and were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mM L-glutamine (BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (Gemini Bio-Products, www.gembio.com). Human monocytes were isolated from PBMC preparations by positive selection with CD14 microbeads from Miltenyi Biotec (www.miltenyibiotec.com) as described by the manufacturer, and were cultured at 1x106 cells per well in 6-well plates in Macrophage-SFM medium (Gibco, www.invitrogen.com) supplemented with 15 ng/ml recombinant human MCSF (R&D, www.rndsystems.com) and 5% heat-inactivated human AB serum (Nabi, Boca Raton, FL). The cell cultures were incubated at 37degreesC and 5% CO2 for 5 days, after which supernatant was replaced with fresh medium lacking MCSF before manipulation. More than 95% of the adherent cells obtained with this technique were CD14+ macrophages as verified by flow cytometry. THP-1 cells were obtained from ATCC (www.atcc.org) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS (BioWhittaker, www.lonzabio.com). 293T cells were obtained from ATCC (www.atcc.org) and were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Gibco, www.invitrogen.com) supplemented with 10% FCS.
