The SerpinB2 Gene is Highly Responsive to LPS
When RAW264.7 macrophages were exposed to LPS, SerpinB2 mRNA was detectable as early as 30 min following LPS challenge, reaching maximal levels at 24 hrs (Fig. 1A). A similar strong induction of LPS-inducible SerpinB2 mRNA expression has been reported previously in murine peritoneal macrophages and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells [4]; [32]. LPS-induced SerpinB2 expression involves both an increase in gene transcription and stabilization of the mRNA [5]; [29]; [42]-[44]. SerpinB2 protein expression was also induced as has been reported in other cell types [31], and detectable after 8 hrs of LPS treatment (Fig. 1).
