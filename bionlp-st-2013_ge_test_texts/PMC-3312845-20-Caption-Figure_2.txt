Effect of sTNFp55R infusion on SE-induced serum-protein extravasation and neuronal damage. (A-D) Serum-protein extravasation and FJB-positive neuronal damages in the PC 3 days after SE. Compared to saline-infused animals, serum-protein extravasation and FJB-positive neuronal damage is markedly ameliorated in sTNFp55R-infused animals. Bars = 400 (A and C) and 50 (B and D) mum. (E) Quantitative analyses of serum-protein extravasation and FJB-positive neuronal damage in the PC 3 days after SE (mean +/- S.E.M). Significant differences from saline-treated animals, *p < 0.05.
