MTb-induced HIV-1 replication in PBMC depends on binding of NFAT5 and NF-kappaB to the LTR.
Specific disruption of the NF-kappaB or NFAT5 binding sites in the HIV-1 subtype B LTR inhibits R5-tropic virus replication in human PBMC after co-infection with MTb. PBMC from four normal donors were infected with 1000 TCID50 HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-WT or the mutants HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB II-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I+II-Mut, or HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-N5-Mut and either; (A) left untreated, or (B) co-infected with MTb isolate CDC1551 (10:1 cells:bacilli). Viral p24 levels in culture supernatants were measured at days 4, 7 and 12 post-infection. (C) Histograms show viral p24 levels at day 12 in the MTb uninfected (grey bars) and MTb co-infected (black bars) PBMC cultures. Replication of the mutant viruses was compared to wild-type virus replication under the same experimental conditions (without and with MTb co-infection, respectively). *, p<0.05; **, p<0.01, as compared to HIV-1Lai/Bal-Env-WT.
