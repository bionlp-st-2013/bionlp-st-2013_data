Inhibition of tumor development in CCR5-/- mice.
A-C, Tumor images, volumes, and weights. B16 melanoma cells (5x105 cells/mouse) were inoculated s.c. into CCR5+/+ mice and CCR5-/- mice (n = 20). Tumor volumes were measured every day and tumor weights were measured at study termination (Day 31). The CCR5-/- mice had a significant reduction in tumor growth and volume as compared to CCR5+/+ mice. The results are expressed as mean +/- SD. * indicates significant difference from CCR5+/+ mice (P<0.05). D, The CCR5-/- mice demonstrated significantly higher survival rates compared to CCR5+/+ mice (by Log-rank Test). E. Tumor sections were analyzed by H&E stain and expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) by immunohistochemistry. Data are means +/- S.D. of four experimental animals. * indicates significant difference from CCR5+/+ mice (P<0.05). Scale bar indicates 50 m.
