NFkappaB p65/p50 and NFATc2/c1 were involved in GP-induced DNA binding. In order to determine whether the DNA binding proteins activated by GP were related to NFkappaB and NFAT, an immuno(dot) blot was performed. A representative dot blot showing staining of negative and positive controls (recombinant proteins NFkappaB p52, c-rel; nuclear extracts of PMA-treated Jurkat cells positive for NFkappaB p50, p65 and for NFATc1, c2) in the upper panel and staining of nuclear extracts of GP-treated PBMC (positive for NFkappaB p65, p50 and NFAT c2, c1) in the lower panel is shown (n = 3).
