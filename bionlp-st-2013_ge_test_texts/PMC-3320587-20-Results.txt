NFAT5 is important for enhancement of HIV-1 subtype C replication in response to MTb infection
As shown in Figure 1, the subtype C LTR was the most active of the HIV-1 LTR subtypes in the reporter assays. Subtype C LTRs generally have three functional NF-kappaB sites in their LTRs, and subtype C is the predominant viral subtype in the African and Asian HIV-1 epidemics where MTb co-infection is extremely common [1], [2], [28], [52]. We thus next extended our analysis of the role of NFAT5 in MTb/HIV-1 co-infection to a subtype C isolate. We first constructed an infectious molecular clone of the HIV-1 subtype C primary isolate HIV-198IN22, which has two NFAT5 binding sites in its LTR and three NF-kappaB sites (Figure 6A). We disrupted the two NFAT5 binding sites by changing the TT of each site to CC to create a mutant virus that we named HIV-198IN22-N5-Mut. Bulk PBMC from four normal donors were infected overnight with 1000 TCID50 of wild-type HIV-198IN22 or HIV-198IN22-N5-Mut and the cultures were then co-infected with MTb CDC1551 or left infected with virus alone. At day 11 post-viral infection, wild-type HIV-198IN22 replication was greater, but not significantly so, as compared to replication of HIV-198IN22 NFAT5-Mut (Figure 6B). However, in the context of MTb co-infection, wild-type HIV-198IN22 replication was significantly increased (p<0.05) at day 11 over HIV-198IN22 NFAT5-Mut replication (Figure 6C), indicating that the absence of NFAT5 binding sites was particularly detrimental to virus replication in the presence of MTb co-infection. Thus, even when three functional NF-kappaB binding sites are present in the LTR, as in the HIV-1 subtype C infectious clone studied here, disruption of NFAT5 binding to the LTR impairs virus replication in response to MTb co-infection.
