siRNA transfection of MDM
An siRNA was constructed (Ambion Inc., www.ambion.com) to target a sequence unique to the NFAT5 transcript: 5'-CAACATGCCTGGAATTCAA-3' (nt 335 to 353) [31]. As described, a control for non-specific siRNA effects, we used an siRNA targeting the green fluorescent protein (GFP), 5'- GGCTACGTCCAGGAGCGCACC-3'. MDM were transfected in 6-well plates using 1 microM of the indicated siRNA in siPORT NeoFX transfection reagent (Ambion Inc., www.ambion.com), prepared as recommended by the manufacturer, in a final volume of 750 microl in Macrophage-SFM medium plus 5% heat-inactivated human AB serum. The cultures were left at 37degreesC overnight after which cells were washed and incubated in fresh medium. MDM were transfected two times for efficient knock down of NFAT5 expression before infection experiments were performed [31].
