NF-kappaB and NFAT5 binding to the HIV-1 LTR can be specifically disrupted
To demonstrate that the impact of NFAT5 silencing on MTb-induced viral replication was a direct effect due to modulation of recruitment of NFAT5 to the HIV-1 LTR and not due to secondary, NFAT5-regulated effects, we set out to disrupt NFAT5 binding to the viral LTR in the context of HIV-1/MTb co-infection. This series of experiments also allowed us to dissect the relative importance of NFAT5 and NF-kappaB binding to the HIV-1 LTR in MTb regulation of HIV-1 replication.
To perform these experiments, we constructed a panel of infectious HIV-1Lai/Bal-env molecular clones where either the NFAT5 site was specifically disrupted or the two NF-kappaB binding sites were either individually or dually disrupted (Figure 3A). Specifically, we constructed a clone in which the NFAT5 binding site was mutated (named HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-N5-Mut) by changing the CC dinucleotide to TT in the core NFAT5 binding site and introduced substitution mutations into the NF-kappaB/NFAT5 shared binding element that we predicted would disrupt NF-kappaB binding but preserve NFAT5 binding. Specifically, we mutated two guanines (GG) in the kappaB I site and changed them to thymine and adenine (TA) (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I-mut) and also introduced the same GG to TA change in the second, more distal NF-kappaB site (kappaB II) in HIV-1Lai/Bal-env (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB II-Mut). We also created a double NF-kappaB site mutant virus (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I+II-Mut) in order to test the impact of complete disruption of NF-kappaB binding to the HIV-1 LTR on MTb regulation.
To determine the specificity of these substitutions upon NFAT5 and NF-kappaB p50/p65 binding to the LTR, we performed a quantitative DNase I footprinting analysis using the wild-type LTR or mutant LTRs in combination with increasing concentrations of recombinant NFAT5 or NF-kappaB p50/p65 proteins. As shown in Figure 3B, the N5-Mut LTR could not bind NFAT5 (compare lanes 12-15 and lanes 17-20), but p50/p65 binding was not impaired (compare lanes 2-5 with lanes 7-10). By contrast, changing the GG dinucleotide to TA in either NF-kappaB binding motif, as predicted, inhibited p50/p65 binding at each site (compare lanes 2-5 with lanes 7-10 and lanes 12-15 of Figure 3C). As expected, mutation of both NF-kappaB sites (kappaB I+II-Mut) resulted in abrogation of p50/p65 binding to the LTR. However, recombinant NFAT5 binding to the single and the double NF-kappaB mutant LTRs was not impaired and indeed appeared enhanced (compare lanes 2-5 to lanes 7-20 of Figure 3D). Thus, binding of NFAT5 or NF-kappaB p50/p65 to their respective motifs can be specifically disrupted within an overlapping or shared binding site.
