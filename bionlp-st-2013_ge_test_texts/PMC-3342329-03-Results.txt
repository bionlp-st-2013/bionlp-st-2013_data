Decrease of NF-kappaB Activity in Tumor Tissue of CCR5-/- Mice
The activation of NF-kappaB plays a critical role in cancer cell survival, especially melanoma cancer cells and in CCR5 expression. To evaluate whether the tumor inhibition was related with the inactivation of NF-kappaB in melanoma, the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB was determined by electromobility shift assay (EMSA) in melanoma tissue. The constitutively activated DNA binding activity was reduced in the CCR5-/- mice tumor tissue (Figure 2A). Moreover, the translocation of p50 and p-p65 into the nucleus through the inhibition of phosphorylation of IkappaB was also prevented in the tumor tissues of CCR5-/- mice (Figure 2B). Immunofluorescence analysis also confirmed that the intensity of nuclear staining for p50 had decreased in the tumor tissues of CCR5-/- mice (Figure 2C).
