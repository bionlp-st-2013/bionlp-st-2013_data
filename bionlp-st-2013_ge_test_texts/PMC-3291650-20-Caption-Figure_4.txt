A20 deficiency in myeloid cells protects against lethal IAV infection.
A20myel-WT (n = 11) and A20myel-KO (n = 11) mice were intranasally infected with a lethal dose of IAV and survival (p<0.001) (A) and weight loss +/- SEM (B) was monitored for respectively 21 and 15 days p.i. BAL fluid was collected from wild type (A20myel-WT) and A20myel-KO mice 6 days following infection with a lethal dose IAV and KC, MIP-2, MCP-1, IL-6 and IFNalpha protein levels were determined (C). Absolute numbers of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes in BAL were analyzed by flow cytometry at 6 days p.i. (D). Numbers are averages +/- SEM of at least 5 mice per group. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments. *p<0.05; **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.
