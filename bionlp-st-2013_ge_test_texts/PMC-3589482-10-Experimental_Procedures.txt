Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays
Radiolabelled, double-stranded oligonucleotide probes for gel shift assays were prepared using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [gamma-32P]-ATP. RAW 264.7 nuclear extracts were prepared by the detergent lysis method [41]. DNA binding reactions (25 microl) containing 10 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 10 microg/ml BSA, 2 mM DTT, 30% glycerol, 20% Ficoll-400, 1 microg poly (dI-dC), 6 microg of nuclear extracts and 10,000 to 20,000 cpm (0.05 to 0.2 ng) of radiolabelled probe were performed for 20 minutes at room temperature. Binding reaction products were resolved by electrophoresis at room temperature on 5% polyacrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide (Bio-Rad)) in 1x TBE at 10V/cm. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were pre-incubated 2 hrs on ice with 4 microg of specific C/EBP antibody. Antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz: anti-C/EBP-alpha (sc-61), anti-C/EBP-beta (sc-150), anti-C/EBP-delta (sc-151) and anti-C/EBP-epsilon (sc-158).
