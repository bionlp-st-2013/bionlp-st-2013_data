Upregulation of IL-1Ra in the Tumor and Spleen of CCR5-/- Mice
To investigate the difference in the cytokine levels between the tumor and spleen tissues of the CCR5+/+ and CCR5-/- mice, we conducted a cytokine array assay using a Mouse Proteome Array (Figure 4A). Among 40 tested cytokines, the levels of IL-1Ra, MIG, MIP-1alpha increased about 686, 9 and 25-fold respectively, in CCR5-/- mice compared to CCR5+/+ mice. Using this technique, no other cytokines were found to be different between the CCR5-/- mice and the CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 4B). Similar altered cytokine levels were found in the spleens of CCR5-/- mice (Figure 4C). Since the IL-1Ra level was the most significantly elevated, the expression of IL-1Ra in tumor and spleen tissues was analyzed by immunofluorescence and western blotting. The expression of IL-1Ra was upregulated in tumor and spleen tissues of the CCR5-/- mice (Figure 4D-G).
