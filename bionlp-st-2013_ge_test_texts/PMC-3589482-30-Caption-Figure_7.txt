Differential recruitment of C/EBP-beta and C/EBP-betaT217 to the murine SerpinB2 promoter in vivo.
Transcription factor occupancy on the SerpinB2 proximal promoter in vivo was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. RAW264.7 macrophages were treated in the presence or absence of LPS for the indicated times and chromatin immunoprecipitation performed using antibodies against C/EBP-beta or p-C/EBP-beta (T217). Soluble chromatin (600-700 ng) was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against C/EBP-beta, p-C/EBP-beta (T217), RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII), or a rabbit IgG (rIgG) control. (A) Typical PCR pattern obtained in ChIP assays using murine SerpinB2 proximal promoter-specific primers, 338/-315 and -5/+19, as diagrammed in top. Recruitment of RNAPII to the SerpinB2 promoter suggests active transcription following LPS stimulation. Minimal background was detected using the rabbit IgG control, indicative of the specificity of the ChIP reaction. (B) qPCR analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitated with antibodies against C/EBP-beta, p-C/EBP-beta (T217), and the rIgG control. The data are represented relative to rIgG signal using the 2-deltadeltaCt method.
