Akt and mTORC1 control autocrine TNFalpha synthesis and JNK activation during necroptosis.
(A) Cells were treated under serum free conditions with bFGF or PDGF with or without zVAD.fmk for 9 hr, followed by qRT-PCR analysis of mTNFalpha. Data was normalized to mouse 18S RNA. (B) Necroptosis was induced by zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha in cells treated with Nec-1, rapamycin (rapa), or Akt inh. VIII inh. followed by qRT-PCR analysis of TNFalpha mRNA levels. (C-F) L929 cells with siRNA knockdown of Akt isoforms (C,E) or mTOR (D,F) were stimulated with zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha for 9 hr, followed by qRT-PCR analysis of mTNFalpha (C,D) or western blot (E,F). In all graphs, average+/-SD was plotted.
