C/EBP-beta is essential for constitutive and LPS-induced SerpinB2 mRNA expression.
(A) Endogenous SerpinB2 mRNA expression is abrogated in Cebpb-/- MEFs compared to Cebpb+/+ MEFs in the absence and presence of LPS. qPCR analysis of murine SerpinB2 mRNA expression in untreated Cebpb+/+ and Cebpb-/- MEFs, and after simulation with LPS (100 ng/ml) for the indicated times. (B) Endogenous SerpinB2 expression is abrogated in C/EBP-beta-deficient inflammatory macrophages. Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (TG macs) were infected with human and murine specific lentiviral shRNAs. Human CEBPB shRNA serves as the non-silencing control since it does not target the murine Cebpb sequence [38]. Lentiviral transduced macrophages were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 hrs. Left: Western blot analysis shows effective knockdown of endogenous C/EBP-beta following infection with murine Cebpb shRNA and not human CEBPB shRNA. Right: qPCR analysis of murine SerpinB2 mRNA expression in the lentiviral transduced peritoneal macrophages. The results represent the mean and SEM of two independent experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate. (*, p<0.05, two-way ANOVA).
