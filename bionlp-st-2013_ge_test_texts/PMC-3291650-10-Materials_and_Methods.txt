In vivo intracellular GrB and IFNgamma staining of activated CD8+ T cells
Granzyme B (GrB) and IFNgamma expressing CD8+ T cells were determined by treating the mice intranasally with 50 microg Brefeldin A (Sigma) as previously described [86]. 6 h later, BAL and lungs were isolated and single cell suspensions were prepared from the lung in the presence of 3 microg/ml Brefeldin A. Cells were stained, fixed and permeabilized (Cytofix/Cytoperm, BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Activated CD8+ T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry based on CD62lo CD3+ and CD8+ expression. Live/Dead fixable aqua dead cell stain kit (Molecular Probes) was used to discriminate live from dead cells.
