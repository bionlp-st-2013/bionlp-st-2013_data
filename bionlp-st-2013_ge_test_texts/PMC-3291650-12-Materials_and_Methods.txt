Western blotting
For total lysates, cells were lysed at 4degreesC for 15 min in lysis buffer (200 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Nuclear and cytoplasmic lysates were prepared by resuspending cells in B1 (10 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM EGTA supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors) for 15 min at 4degreesC. Next, NP-40 detergent was added to a final concentration of 0.65% and cells were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min. The nuclear fraction containing pellet was lyzed in B2 (20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 1% NP-40, 400 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM EGTA supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors) for 15 min at 4degreesC. The lysates were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blotting and ECL detection (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). Immunoblots were revealed with anti-A20, anti-IkappaBalpha, anti-p65, and anti-histon H1 (Santa Cruz), anti-IRF3 (Invitrogen), anti-phospho-IRF3 and anti-phospho-IkappaBalpha (Cell Signaling) and anti-actin (MP Biomedicals). The density of the bands was quantified (fold induction) with the ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij) Gel analyzer tool. All intensities were calculated relative to the first lane ( = time 0).
