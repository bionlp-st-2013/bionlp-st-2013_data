2.1. Primary Culture and Identification of Mouse Astrocytes
Nrf2 knockout ICR mice were kindly provided by Dr. Thomas W. Kensler (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA). Primary astrocytes were obtained from postnatal 2-day-old Nrf2 wide type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice (6 mice for each genotype). Following decapitation, the cortices were dissected out, and the meninges and associated blood vessels were removed. The tissue was roughly chopped with a scalpel blade, incubated in 0.5% trypsin for 10 minutes at 37degreesC, and agitated every few minutes. After digestion, the tissue was rinsed twice in DMEM with 10% FBS, followed by a mechanical dissociation in DMEM with 20% FBS and 5 units/mL penicillin, 5 mug/mL streptomycin (complete culture medium). After incubation for 1 h, the supernatant was transferred to a new flask or dish (Costar, USA) for depleting the residual epithelial cells. Then the cells were cultivated at 37degreesC with 5% CO2. And the complete culture medium was half-changed twice a week. Astrocytes expanded for about 7 days to reach confluence. Then the flasks or dishes were shaken at 150 rpm for 4 h to deplete the microglia and less adherent cells from the cultures. After shaking, the resulting cultures were mainly astrocytes, which were determined by immunoreactivity for GFAP (sc-166481, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA). Cells passaged for 2-3 generations were used in the following studies.
