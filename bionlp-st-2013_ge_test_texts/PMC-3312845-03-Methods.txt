Intracerebroventricular drug infusion
Rats were divided into two groups: vehicle (saline)-treated and soluble TNFp55 receptor (sTNFp55R, 50 mug/ml; Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO)-treated groups. The dosage of sTNFp55R was determined as the highest dose that induced SE of comparable severity in 100% of animals with 5% mortality in the preliminary study. Animals were anesthetized (Zolretil, 50 mg/kg, i.m.; Virbac Laboratories, France) and placed in a stereotaxic frames. For the osmotic pump implantation, holes were drilled through the skull to introduce a brain infusion kit 1 (Alzet, Cupertino, CA) into the right lateral ventricle (1 mm posterior; 1.5 mm lateral; - 3.5 mm depth; flat skull position with bregma as reference), according to the atlas of Paxinos and Watson [24]. The infusion kit was sealed with dental cement and connected to an osmotic pump (1007D, Alzet, Cupertino, CA). The pump was placed in a subcutaneous pocket in the dorsal region. Animals received 0.5 mul/hr of vehicle or compound for 1 week. Therefore, the dose of sTNFp55R was 0.6 mug/day per each animal. The compounds began to be immediately infused after surgery. Since the volume of vasogenic edema peaked at 2-3 days after SE in our previous studies [5-8,20], we chose this time point. Thus, our experimental schedules at least inhibit the function of TNF-alpha from 3 days prior to SE to 4 days after SE when the volume of vasogenic edema peaked.
