Potential cis-acting regulatory elements in the LPS responsive region of the murine SerpinB2 promoter
-563/-1. Mouse and human nucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal W software. Cis-acting elements conserved between the human and murine SerpinB2 promoters are boxed and labeled. AP-1 =  activator protein 1; C/EBP =  CCAAT enhancer binding protein; CRE = cAMP response element; Oct1 =  octamer transcription factor 1/POU2F1; PU.1 =  purine box binding protein 1. The putative transcription initiation site (tis) is indicated and exon 1 is presented in uppercase. The location of the 5' ends of the -539, -189 and -87 reporter constructs are also shown.
