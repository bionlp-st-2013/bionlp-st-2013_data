2.2. Induction of Intracerebral Hemorrhage
Since most intracerebral hemorrhages occur in the basal ganglia clinically, in the present study, rat model of ICH was induced in left basal ganglia. Rats were anesthetized with intra-peritoneal sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg). The body (rectal) temperature was maintained at 37degreesC during the surgery using a feedback-controlled heating system. The rats were positioned in a stereotactic frame, and the scalp was incised along the midline. Using a sterile technique, a 1 mm burr hole was opened in the skull on the left coronal suture 3 mm lateral to the midline. A blunt 26-gauge needle was inserted into the left basal ganglia under stereotactic guidance (coordinates: 0.2 mm anterior, 6.0 mm ventral, and 3.0 mm lateral to the midline). Then, a 75 muL of autologous whole blood was infused at a rate of 20 muL/min with the use of a microinfusion pump. After the completion of the infusion, the needle was withdrawn quickly, cyanoacrylate glue was placed around the burr hole, and the skin incision was closed with sutures. For the normal saline control rats, only 75 muL normal saline was injected.
