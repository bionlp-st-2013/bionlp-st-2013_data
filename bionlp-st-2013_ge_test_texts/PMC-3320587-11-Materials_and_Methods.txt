Western blot
Whole cell extracts were collected with lysis buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton, 10% glycerol, and 1 tablet of Complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) per 25 ml of buffer. Extracts were boiled for 5 min in 1x Laemmli sample buffer with 5% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was transferred to a nitrocellulose Trans-Blot Transfer Membrane (BioRad). The blot was then blocked for 1 h at 37degreesC in a solution of 4% BSA (Sigma) and 0.1% Tween-20 (BioRad) in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl at pH 7.6 (BSA/TBST). Primary incubation was carried out with a1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-NFAT5 antibody (H-300) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a 1:500 dilution of goat anti-Lamin-B1 antibody (sc-6217; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in BSA/TBST for 2 h at room temperature. The blot was washed 3x5 min in TBST and incubated in 1:6000 donkey anti-goat-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or goat anti-rabbit-HRP (BioRad) as appropriate for 1 h. The blot was again washed 3x5 min in TBST and developed with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Reagent (Pierce).
