Negative regulation of NF-kappaB and its involvement in rheumatoid arthritis
The transcription factor NF-kappaB plays crucial roles in the regulation of inflammation and mmune responses, and inappropriate NF-kappaB activity has been linked with many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. Cells employ a multilayered control system to keep NF-kappaB signalling in check, including a repertoire of negative feedback regulators ensuring termination of NF-kappaB responses. Here we will review various negative regulatory mechanisms that have evolved to control NF-kappaB signalling and which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.
