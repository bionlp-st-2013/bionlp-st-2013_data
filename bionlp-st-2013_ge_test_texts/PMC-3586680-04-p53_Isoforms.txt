At least nine isoforms of p53 have been identified due to alternative mRNA splicing, multiple gene promoters, and alternative initiation sites of translation (Ghosh et al., 2004; Ray et al., 2006; Figure 2). In cancers, aberrant expression of p53 isoforms occurs frequently (Bourdon et al., 2005; Bourdon, 2007). Full-length p53, delta133p53, and p53beta are localized mainly in the nucleus, and only few of them are in cytoplasm. p53gamma and delta133p53beta are localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm. delta133p53gamma is localized in the cytoplasm (Bourdon et al., 2005). Co-transfection of p53 and p53beta increases p53-mediated apoptosis, whereas co-expression of p53 with delta133p53 suppresses p53-mediated apoptosis (Bourdon et al., 2005). delta133p53 differentially regulates gene expression in p53-dependent and -independent manners (Aoubala et al., 2011). Co-expression of delta133p53beta or delta133p53gamma with p53 does not affect p53 transcriptional activity on p21 and Bax promoters, as well as apoptosis.
