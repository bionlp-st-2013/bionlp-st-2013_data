Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is the most common co-infection and cause of death in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [1], [2]. Direct engagement of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) by MTb on mononuclear phagocytes activates signaling cascades that directly induce transcription from the proviral LTR (reviewed in [3]). Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines produced by the human host in response to MTb infection activate signal transduction pathways in CD4 T cells and monocytic cells that also result in transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR [4]-[6]. Activation of HIV-1 replication via these MTb-induced pathways ultimately leads to higher viral loads and, in turn, expedited CD4 T cell loss and progression to AIDS ([7], reviewed in [8]-[10]). Furthermore, the progressive immune compromise associated with HIV-1 infection itself is a major cause of latent MTb reactivation, as well as increased susceptibility to primary TB infection ([11]-[15], reviewed in [8]).
The primary PRR on monocytic cells triggered by MTb infection is toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 [16]-[20]. Engagement of TLR2 results in engagement of the adaptor protein MyD88 and the subsequent recruitment of several kinases, including IRAK1 and IRAK4, and the ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 ([21]-[23], reviewed in [10], [24]). TRAF6 activates IkappaB kinase (IKK) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases that, in turn, ultimately induce activation of specific transcription factor families, including the NF-kappaB and AP-1 families, which have been shown to associate with the HIV-1 LTR and to drive its transcription ([22], [25]-[27], reviewed in [10]).
Notably, HIV-1 comprises several subtypes, and the LTR of each subtype is unique with respect to the number and organization of activator binding sites. For example, HIV-1 subtype B, the most highly characterized viral subtype and the primary cause of infection in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Australia, has two tandem NF-kappaB motifs in its LTR. By contrast, HIV-1 subtypes C and E, which have spread disproportionately in TB-burdened sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, have three and one NF-kappaB binding sites, respectively [1], [28]-[30].
We previously showed that the most primordial member of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family, NFAT5 (also known as TonEBP), binds to a site within the HIV-1 LTR that is highly conserved across all HIV-1 subtypes, and is also conserved in HIV-2 and SIV LTRs. This NFAT5 site overlaps the core NF-kappaB binding motifs in the LTR and is required for constitutive replication of representative HIV-1 subtype B, C, and E isolates in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) [31]. Given that NFAT5 has previously been shown to be transcriptionally activated by the MAP kinase p38, which is downstream of MyD88 signaling, [32], we speculated that NFAT5 may also be involved in MTb-induced activation of HIV-1 replication via a TLR-mediated pathway in monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).
Here, we show that NFAT5 and its cognate binding site are of crucial importance for efficient MTb-induced stimulation of HIV-1 replication in human MDM and PBMC. Moreover, we demonstrate that MTb infection increases NFAT5 gene expression in human monocytes in a MyD88-dependent manner. Thus, these results expand the known stimuli of NFAT5 expression to the PRR-mediated innate immune response, and demonstrate that NFAT5 is a critical modulator of MTb-induced enhancement of HIV-1 replication.
