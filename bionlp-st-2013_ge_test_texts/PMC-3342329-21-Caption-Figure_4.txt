Upregulation of IL-1Ra in the tumor and spleen of CCR5-/- mice.
A, Figure 4A indicates mouse cytokine array panel coordinates. Nitrocellulose membranes contain 40 different anti-cytokine antibodies printed in duplicate. B, Mouse cytokine array panel indicate the cytokine expression difference in tumor tissues of CCR5+/+ mice and CCR5-/- mice, especially IL-1Ra. Representative blot from three independent experiments is shown. Positive controls show the manufacturer's internal positive control samples on the membrane. C, Protein immune-arrays were performed using Mouse cytokine array in spleen tissues. There were differences in cytokines between CCR5+/+ mice and CCR5-/- mice, especially IL-1Ra. Representative blot from three independent experiments is shown. Positive controls show the manufacturer's internal positive control samples on the membrane. D and E, Immunolfluorescence analysis was used to determine the expression levels of IL-1Ra in tumor and spleen tissues. The reactive cell number was determined as the number of DAPI-stained, IL-1Ra antibody-positive cells that were counted. Values are the mean +/- S.D. of four experimental animals. * indicates statistically significant differences from CCR5+/+ mice. Scale bar indicates 50 microm. F and G, Expression of IL-1Ra was analyzed by western blotting in tumor and spleen tissues. Each band is representative of three independent experimental results. Data are means +/- S.D. of three experimental animals. * indicates significant difference from CCR5+/+ mice (p<0.05).
