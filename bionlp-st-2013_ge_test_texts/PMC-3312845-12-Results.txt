TNF-alpha, and TNF receptor expression
In non-SE induced animals of the saline-infused groups, TNF-alpha immunoreactivity was weakly detected in PC neurons (data not shown). In 12 hr-post SE animals of the saline-infused group, most of the activated microglia showed strong TNF-alpha immunoreactivity (Figure 1A). This expression pattern was maintained up to 1 week after SE. In non-SE-induced animals of the saline-infused groups, TNFp55R and TNFp75R immunoreactivities were also weakly observed in astrocytes (data not shown). In 12 hr-post SE animals of the saline-infused group, TNFp55R immunoreactivity was observed in astrocytes (Figure 1B). Unlike TNFp55R, TNFp75R immunoreactivity was detected in endothelial cells as well as astrocytes (Figures 1C-E). One day to 1 week after SE, both TNFp55R and TNFp75R immunoreactivities were significantly reduced in astrocytes, not in endothelial cells, due to massive astroglial loss (data not shown) [5,7,8,20].
