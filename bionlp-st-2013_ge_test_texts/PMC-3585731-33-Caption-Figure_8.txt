Akt signaling contributes to autocrine TNFalpha production in multiple cell types.
FADD deficient Jurkat cells were treated with TNFalpha followed by measurement of (A) human TNFalpha mRNA levels by qRT-PCR and normalized using human 18S RNA or (B) western blot at 9 hr. RAW 264.7 or J774A.1 cells were treated with zVAD.fmk (100 uM or 50 uM respectively) followed by (C,E) measurement of TNFalpha mRNA levels by qRT-PCR or (D,F) western blot at 9 hr. (G) Akt null mouse lung fibroblasts expressing Myr-Akt or K179M were treated with zVAD.fmk and TNFalpha followed by measurement of TNFalpha mRNA levels by qRT-PCR at 9 hr. (H) Mouse lung fibroblasts expressing only endogenous Akt1 or Akt2 were treated with zVAD.fmk and TNFalpha followed by measurement of TNFalpha mRNA levels by qRT-PCR at 9 hr.
