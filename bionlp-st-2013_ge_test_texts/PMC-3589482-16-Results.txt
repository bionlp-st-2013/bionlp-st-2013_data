A C/EBP, CRE and Two AP-1 Sites in the Murine SerpinB2 Gene Proximal Promoter are Essential for Optimal LPS-inducible Transcription
To investigate regulatory elements between -539 and -189 essential for LPS-inducible transcription, several candidate binding sites for transcription factors previously reported to mediate LPS-inducible transcription in other genes [57] were targeted by nucleotide substitution designed to disrupt transcription factor binding to the pGLmP-539 murine SerpinB2 promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, mutation of the consensus E box (-538/-533), PU.1 (-412/-407), or the variant Oct-1 (-296/-288) site did not decrease LPS-induced promoter activity. In contrast, mutation of the C/EBP site (-203/-192) completely eliminated promoter activity, similar to the levels observed for the -189 SerpinB2 promoter deletion construct. Others have also recently implicated this C/EBP site in LPS-induced activation of the SerpinB2 gene [58].
Considering the conserved sequence and position of the CRE and two AP-1 sites in the murine SerpinB2 promoter and their demonstrated involvement in the PMA-responsiveness of the human SERPINB2 promoter [37], these sites were also mutated by nucleotide substitution to investigate whether they played a role in the LPS response of the murine SerpinB2 promoter. As shown in Fig. 4B, mutation of the CRE at -177/-172 or either of the two AP-1 sites at -106/-100 and -94/-88, completely or significantly reduced LPS-inducible luciferase activity from the murine SerpinB2 promoter. These data show that the C/EBP element, as well as the CRE and both AP-1 cis-acting elements are critical for LPS-inducible transcription from the SerpinB2 proximal promoter.
