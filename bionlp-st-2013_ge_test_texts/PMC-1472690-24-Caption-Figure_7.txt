Inhibition of GP-induced NFkappaB, NFAT and NFIL-6 DNA binding to the IL-1RA promoter. A, A representative autoradiogram (lane 1: control, lane 2: GP, lane 3: GP + unlabeled mutated NFATP2/3 oligo, lane 4: GP + CAPE, lane 5: GP + CyA, lane 6: GP + CHX, lane 7: GP + unlabeled NFATP2/3 oligo, lane 8: water) as well as a graphical summary for the NFATP2/3 site, depicting a decrease in binding following inhibition when compared to GP is displayed (* = p < 0.05). Data are shown as mean +/- SEM (n = 4). B, Inhibition of NFkappaB, NFAT and NFIL-6 resulted in decreased IL-1RA mRNA following CHX, CAPE or CyA compared to GP. GAPDH is used as housekeeping control (representative gel, n = 4). C, Inhibition of NFkappaB, NFAT and NFIL-6 significantly reduced the production of IL-1RA by human PBMC following treatment with CHX, CAPE or CyA when compared to GP (* = p < 0.05; ** = p < 0.01). Data are shown as mean +/- SEM (n = 3).
