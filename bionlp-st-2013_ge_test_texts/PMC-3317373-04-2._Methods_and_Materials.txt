2.3. Cell Death Measurement by CCK-8 Assay
1 x 103/well cells were seeded to 96-well culture plates and cultivated for 24 h to adhere. Then the cell was scrated as mentioned above. Astrocyte cell death was assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) (Dojindo, Japan) assay 24 h after scratch according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 10 muL CCK-8 was added into every well and incubated for 1 h. Then OD value was read at 450 nm using a Bio-Rad ELISA microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA). All measurements were performed in sextuplicate. Results were expressed as mean of OD value at 450 nm +/- SD.
