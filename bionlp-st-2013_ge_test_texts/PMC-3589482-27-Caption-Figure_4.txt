Identification of cis-acting elements required for the LPS-responsiveness of the murine SerpinB2 promoter.
(A) Schematic representation of the -539/+92 region of the murine SerpinB2 promoter with the location of candidate cis-acting regulatory elements indicated with boxes. The location of the 5' ends of the -539, -189 and -87 reporter constructs is also shown. Positions of murine SerpinB2 proximal promoter-specific primers, 338/-315 and -5/+19 used in ChIP assays are indicated. (B) RAW 264.7 macrophages were transiently transfected with the indicated murine SerpinB2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs and either left untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 16 hrs. The results show relative luciferase activity following LPS treatment and represent the mean and SEM of 4-7 independent experiments.
