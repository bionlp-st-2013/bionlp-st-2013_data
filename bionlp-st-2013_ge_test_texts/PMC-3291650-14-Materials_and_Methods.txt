Cytokine quantification
For TNF ELISA, 96-well plates were coated with TNF coating (TN3-19, eBioscience) and detection (R4-6A2, eBioscience) antibodies. IFNalpha and IFNbeta protein levels were determined with an ELISA kit (PBL Biomedical Laboratories). For IFNgamma ELISA, 96-well plates were coated with IFNgamma coating (XMG1.2) and detection (R4-6A2) antibodies (eBiosciences). Detection of MCP-1, KC, TNF, IL-1beta and IL-6 in BAL fluid was performed using Bioplex (BioRad) technology according to the manufacturer's instructions. Milliplex technology (Millipore) was used for the detection of MIP-2 in BAL fluid.
