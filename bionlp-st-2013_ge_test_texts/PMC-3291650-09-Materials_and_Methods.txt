Determination of HAI (hemagglutination inhibition) titers
To determine the HAI titers in infected mice, sera of these were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE/Cholera filtrate; Sigma) to remove sialic acids from serum proteins capable of aspecific inhibition of agglutination. After incubation overnight at 37degreesC, the RDE was inactivated by addition of 0.75% sodium citrate in PBS and heating to 56degreesC for 30 min. To remove sialic acid binding proteins, sera were cleared with 1/10 volume 50% chicken RBC. Titration was done by incubating a two-fold dilution series of sera with 4 HA units of X-47 virus for 1 hour at room temperature in 96-well U-bottom plates. Finally, an equal volume of 0.5% chicken RBC was added and titers were read 30 min later. Negative controls included PBS instead of immune serum (agglutination control) or PR8 instead of X-47 virus (control for agglutination effect of sera); as positive control, serum from a mouse infected twice with a sublethal dose of X-47 was used.
