Double immunofluorescence study
Sections were incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Sections were then incubated in a mixture of goat anti-TNF-alpha IgG (1:1000, R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN)/mouse anti-OX-42 IgG (1:100, Serotec, Cambridge, UK), mouse anti-GFAP IgG (1:1000, an astroglial marker, Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA)/rabbit anti-TNFp55R IgG (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), mouse anti-GFAP IgG/rabbit anti-TNFp75R IgG (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), mouse anti-SMI-71 IgM (1:1000, Covance, Berkeley, CA)/rabbit anti-TNFp75R IgG, mouse anti-GFAP IgG/rabbit anti-NF-kappaB (p65-Ser276, p65-Ser311, p65-Ser529, and p65-Thr435) IgG (1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), mouse anti-SMI-71 IgM/rabbit anti-p65-Thr435 NF-kappaB IgG, mouse anti-SMI-71 IgM/rabbit anti-GLUT-1 IgG (1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or mouse anti-GFAP IgG/rabbit anti-MIP-2 IgG (1:100) in PBS containing 0.3% triton X-100 overnight at room temperature. After washing three times for 10 minutes with PBS, sections were also incubated in a mixture of FITC- and Cy3-conjugated secondary antisera (Amersham, San Francisco, CA), diluted 1:200, for 2 hr at room temperature. The sections were washed three times for 10 min with PBS, and mounted on gelatin-coated slides. For nuclei counterstaining, we used Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector, Burlingame, CA). All images were captured using an AxioImage M2 microscope and AxioVision Rel. 4.8 software.
