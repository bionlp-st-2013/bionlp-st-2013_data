A20 negatively regulates IAV-induced gene expression in BMDM and alveolar macrophages.
(A-B) BMDM isolated from A20myel-WT and A20myel-KO animals were infected with IAV (moi 1). At different hours post infection (hours p.i.) cells were lysed and IL-6, IFNbeta and A20 mRNA expression was analyzed by qPCR (A). 18 hours post infection cell culture supernatant was analyzed for TNF and IFNbeta protein levels by ELISA and multiplexing technologies (B). (C-D) Alveolar macrophages were mock treated or infected with IAV (moi 1) for 18 hours. IL-6 and IFNbeta mRNA expression was determined by qPCR (C). Cell culture supernatant was analyzed for IL-6 and IFNbeta protein levels by ELISA and multiplexing technologies (D). Error bars represent mean values (+/- SEM) of 2-3 samples. Results are representative for 2 independent experiments. ***p<0,001.
