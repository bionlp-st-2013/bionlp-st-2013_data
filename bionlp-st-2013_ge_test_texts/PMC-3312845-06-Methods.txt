Immunohistochemistry
Free-floating sections were first incubated with 10% normal goat serum for 30 min at room temperature. They were then incubated in rabbit anti-MPO IgG (1:100, Thermo fisher scientific) or rabbit anti-MIP-2 IgG (1:200, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO) and 2% normal goat serum(Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO) overnight at room temperature. After washing three times for 10 min with PBS, the sections were incubated sequentially, in goat anti-rabbit or horse anti-mouse IgG (Vector, Burlingame, CA) and ABC complex (Vector, Burlingame, CA), diluted 1:200 in the same solution as the primary antiserum. Between the incubations, the tissues were washed with PBS three times for 10 min each. To confirm vasogenic edema, some tissue sections were reacted for serum-proteins using horse anti-rat IgG (Vector, Burlingame, CA) as a primary antibody. The sections were visualized with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO) in 0.1 M Tris buffer and mounted on the gelatin-coated slides. The immunoreactions were observed under the Axioscope microscope (Carl Zeiss, Munchen-Hallbergmoos). For negative controls, rat hippocampal tissues were incubated with 1 mug of the antibody that was preincubated with 1 mug of purified peptide for 1 hr at room temperature or incubated with pre-immune serum instead of the primary antibody. For negative controls, tissues were incubated with pre-immune serum instead of primary antibody.
