RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and qPCR
Total RNA was extracted using Aurum Total RNA mini kit (BioRad) and reverse transcribed into cDNA with iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. qPCR was performed by using SYBR Green I master mix I (Roche) in the Lightcycler 480 detection system (Roche) with the following primers: HPRT: 5'-AGTGTTGGATACAGGCCAGAC-3' and 5'CGTGATTCAAATCCCTGAAGT-3'; IL-6: 5'-GAGGATACCACTCCCAACAGACC-3' and 5'-AAGTGCATCATCGTTGTTCATACA-3'; IFNbeta: 5'-TCAGAATGAGTGGTGGTTGC-3' and 5'-GACCTTTCAAATGCAGTAGATTCA-3'; A20: 5'-AAACCAATGGTGATGGAAACTG-3' and 5'-GTTGTCCCATTCGTCATTCC-3'; CCL2: 5'-TTAAAAACCTGGATCGGAACCAA-3' and 5'-GCATTAGCTTCAGATTTACGGGT-3'; CXCL1: 5'-GAGCCTCTAACCAGTTCCAG-3' and 5'-TGAGTGTGGCTATGACTTCG-3' and IFNalpha4: 5'-TGATGAGCTACTACTGGTCAGC-3' and 5'-GATCTCTTAGCACAAGGATGGC-3'. Primers were designed with PerlPrimer (http://perlprimer.sourceforge.net). Quantification was performed using the comparative CT method (deltadeltaCT). Results are expressed relative to HPRT values.
