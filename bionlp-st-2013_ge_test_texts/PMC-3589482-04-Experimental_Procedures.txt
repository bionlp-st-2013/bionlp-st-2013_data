DNA Sequence Analysis
The DNA sequence of the murine SerpinB2 promoter was determined by sequencing the pUC-based plasmids pDB9406, pDB9402-41 and pDB9402-42, in addition to plasmids prepared from pDB9402-41 and pDB9402-42 containing deletions introduced by exonuclease III digestion. Plasmids pDB9406, pDB9402-41 and pDB9402-42 containing genomic DNA isolated from a lambdaFIXII (Stratagene) genomic library prepared from a 129 mouse strain, were kindly provided by Dr. Dominique Belin, University of Geneva. pDB9406 contains a 4.4 kb EcoRI/SpeI genomic fragment spanning the transcription initiation site; pDB9402-41 and pDB9402-42 contain a 1.2 kb EcoRI genomic fragment, located immediately upstream of the pDB9406 EcoRI fragment, cloned in opposite orientations. Subcloned inserts were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. The nucleotide sequence of the 4480 bp murine SerpinB2 gene 5' flanking region was determined using the ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer) and a PE 373A sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). This sequence was deposited in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ Data Bank with Accession No. AF339731.
