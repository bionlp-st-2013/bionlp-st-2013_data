Quantitative analyses of the effect of sTNFp55R infusion on NF-kappaB phosphorylation and SMI-71 expression. (A) Quantitative analysis of NF-kappaB phosphorylation 12 hr after SE (mean +/- S.E.M). Significant differences from saline-infused animals, *p < 0.05. (B) Quantitative analysis of SMI-71 expression 1 day after SE (mean +/- S.E.M). Significant differences from saline-infused animals, *p < 0.05. (C) Linear regression analysis between p65-Thr435 phosphorylation and SMI-71 in the PC following SE.
