Cells and transfection
HEK293T and MDCK cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.4 mM sodium pyruvate and antibiotics. HEK293T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitate transfection method with specific expression vectors (pCAGGS-E-hA20 (LMBP 3778), pCAGGS-E-RIG-I-CARD (LMBP 6517), pEF-HA-IRF-7 (kindly provided by T. Taniguchi, Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo)), NF-kappaB, IRF3, IRF7 reporter plasmids (respectively pConLuc (LMBP3248), pISRE-luc (LMBP4011), pGL3-IFNalpha4-luc (kindly provided by J. Hiscott, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada), and pACTbetagal (LMBP4341) for transfection efficiency normalization. Details of plasmids are presented along with detailed sequence maps at the BCCM-LMBP plasmid databank http://bccm.belspo.be/index.php.
For the generation of BMDM, bone marrow cells were cultured 7 days in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.4 mM sodium pyruvate, antibiotics and 40 ng/ml recombinant M-CSF. BMDM were of >=95% purity as measured by flow cytometry using F4/80 and CD11b specific antibodies. For the isolation of alveolar macrophages, the trachea was canulated and the lung was flushed 4 times with HBSS containing 1 mM EDTA. Alveolar macrophages were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 1% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.4 mM sodium pyruvate and antibiotics.
