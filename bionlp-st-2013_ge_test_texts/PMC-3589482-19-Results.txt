C/EBP-beta Mediates both Constitutive and LPS-induced SerpinB2 mRNA Expression in MEFs and Inflammatory Primary Macrophages
To investigate the importance of C/EBP-beta to endogenous SerpinB2 mRNA expression in response to LPS, we utilized C/EBP-beta-null (Cebpb-/-) and wild-type MEFs (Cebpb+/+), since RAW264.7 cells constitutively express endogenous C/EBP-beta. Wild-type MEFs express low levels of endogenous SerpinB2 and the absence of C/EBP-beta attenuated endogenous SerpinB2 mRNA expression. LPS stimulated an increase in SerpinB2 mRNA expression in wild-type MEFs (Fig. 6A), whereas LPS-stimulated SerpinB2 mRNA expression was significantly dampened in Cebpb-/- MEFs as compared to wild-type. We next tested if similar effects could be seen in thioglycollate-elicited inflammatory macrophages in which C/EBP-beta expression was knocked down using species-specific lentiviral shRNAs (Fig. 6B, left). As was observed in MEFs, both constitutive and LPS-induced SerpinB2 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in C/EBP-beta-deficient inflammatory macrophages (Fig. 6B, right). These data show that C/EBP-beta is critical for mediating constitutive and LPS-inducible transcription of endogenous SerpinB2 mRNA.
