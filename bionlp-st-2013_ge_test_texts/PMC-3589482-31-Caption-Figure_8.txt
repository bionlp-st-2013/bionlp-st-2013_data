C/EBP-beta is necessary for SerpinB2 proximal promoter activity.
(A) The SerpinB2 proximal promoter is significantly activated in LPS-stimulated Cebpb+/+ MEFs and not in Cebpb-/- MEFs. Murine SerpinB2 gene promoter activity measured in Cebpb+/+ and Cebpb-/- MEFs expressing the pGLmP-539 SerpinB2 promoter-luciferase reporter in the presence or absence of LPS (100 ng/mL). Cells were co-transfected with the pGLmP-539 SerpinB2 promoter-luciferase reporter and beta-galactosidase reporter plasmids, and luciferase units normalized to beta-galactosidase activity. (B) C/EBP-beta gene schematic depicting gene structure and phospho-acceptor sites. (C) Phosphorylation of C/EBP-beta at Serine 64 negatively regulates LPS-stimulated SerpinB2 promoter activity. Cebpb-/- MEFs were co-transfected with expression plasmids encoding wild-type C/EBP-beta or the indicated C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor mutants, along with the pGLmP-539 SerpinB2 promoter-luciferase reporter and beta-galactosidase reporter plasmids, and stimulated with LPS for 4 hrs. Luciferase activity was quantified and normalized to beta-galactosidase activity. The western blot (below the graphs) confirms the expression of the respective C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor mutants. The C/EBP-betaT217A -transfected MEFs express both the 38 kDa and 35 kDa isoforms of C/EBP-beta. The results represent the mean and SEM of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. (*, p<0.05, one-way ANOVA).
