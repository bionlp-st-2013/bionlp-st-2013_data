A20 inhibits RIG-I-induced NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation
RIG-I signaling induces the activation of NF-kappaB, IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors, which promote the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs that restrict further viral propagation. Previous studies have shown that ectopically expressed A20 negatively regulates NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation upon RIG-I stimulation [50]-[52]. Similarly, we show that A20 overexpression in HEK293T cells prevents NF-kappaB- and IRF3-dependent luciferase reporter gene activation induced by transfection of a truncated constitutive active form of RIG-I [53], corresponding to only the two N-terminal CARD domains of RIG-I [RIG-I (2CARD)] (figure 1A, left and middle graph). We next investigated whether A20 also inhibits IRF7 activation. Unlike IRF3, IRF7 is not or weakly expressed under naive conditions and IRF7 protein levels are rapidly upregulated upon virus-induced IRF3 activation [54], [55]. To determine the effect of A20 on IRF7 activation, we therefore transfected minor amounts of an IRF7 expression plasmid together with plasmids encoding RIG-I (2CARD), A20 and an IRF7-specific IFNalpha4 luciferase reporter construct. RIG-I (2CARD) expression in the absence of IRF7 co-expression showed negligible IFNalpha4 promoter activation (grey bar, figure 1A, right graph), whereas significant reporter gene expression was observed in the presence of IRF7. Similar to its inhibitory effect on NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation, A20 also prevented RIG-I-induced IRF7 activation (figure 1A, right graph). These results demonstrate the potential of A20 to inhibit RIG-I-induced NF-kappaB and IRF3/7 activation.
To study the effect of endogenously expressed A20 on RIG-I-induced signaling in a more immunological relevant context, we performed further experiments in A20 deficient primary macrophages. Since A20 full knockout mice die prematurely as a result of severe multi-organ inflammation [37], we generated mice carrying a conditional A20 allele in which exon IV and exon V were flanked by two loxP sites [56]. Crossing these mice with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the lysozyme M promoter leads to specific deletion in myeloid cells and allowed us to generate myeloid cell specific A20 knockout mice [48]. To stimulate the RIG-I receptor, we transfected A20myel-KO BMDM and wild type control cells with minimal amounts of low molecular weight (LMW) poly(I:C), which is known to preferentially bind and activate RIG-I rather than MDA5 [57]. Of note, this concentration of poly(I:C) was unable to induce significant TLR3 dependent NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation or cytokine production (data not shown). As expected, poly(I:C) transfection induced the rapid expression of A20 in wild type, but not in A20myel-KO BMDM (figure 1B, upper panel). At early time points, slightly slower migrating forms of A20 were observed, indicating that A20 undergoes a yet unknown modification upon poly(I:C) transfection. Compared to wild type BMBM, A20 deficient cells showed enhanced NF-kappaB activation as indicated by increased phosphorylation and sustained degradation of IkappaBalpha (figure 1B). Furthermore, nuclear translocation of the p65 NF-kappaB subunit was enhanced in poly(I:C) transfected A20myel-KO BMDM, reaching a maximum at earlier time points compared to wild type cells (figure 1C). IRF3 is known to be activated upon phosphorylation of a series of carboxyl terminal serine residues by the IKK-like kinases TBK1 and IKKepsilon [58], leading to its dimerization and subsequent translocation to the nucleus [59]. Using immunoblotting with an antibody directed against phosphorylated Ser396, maximum IRF3 phosphorylation was detected at earlier time points in A20myel-KO BMDM compared to wild type BMDM (figure 1B). Similar to p65, IRF3 nuclear translocation reached its maximum at an earlier time point in A20 deficient BMDM compared to wild type cells (figure 1C). NF-kappaB controls the expression of IL-6 and TNF, and NF-kappaB and IRF3 control the expression of IFNbeta. In line with the enhanced activation of NF-kappaB and IRF3 as described above, A20myel-KO BMDM secreted increased amounts of IL-6, TNF and IFNbeta (figure 1D). Similar results were obtained using peritoneal macrophages (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that A20 plays an important role in the negative regulation of RIG-I-induced NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation in primary macrophages.
