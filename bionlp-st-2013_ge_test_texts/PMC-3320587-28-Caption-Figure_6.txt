Disruption of the NFAT5 site in HIV-1 subtype C significantly impairs MTb-induced viral replication.
(A) Mutation of the NFAT5 binding site in an HIV-1 subtype C infectious molecular clone. NFAT5 binding site mutations were introduced into the LTR of subtype C HIV-198IN22-WT. The NFAT5 binding site mutant (HIV-198IN22 N5-Mut) LTR sequence is shown alongside that of HIV-198IN22-WT. The HIV-198IN22 isolate analyzed here contains three NF-kappaB and two NFAT5 binding sites. The unique 3' terminal adenine, which is important for NFAT5 binding to its site, is shown in blocks. Mutations were introduced into the 3' LTR of the HIV-198IN22-WT proviral sequence. PBMC from four normal donors were infected with 1000 TCID50 of HIV-198IN22-WT or HIV-198IN22-N5-Mut. Cells were then (B) left infected with virus alone or (C) co-infected with MTb strain CDC1551 (10:1 cells:bacilli). Culture supernatants were collected at days 3, 7 and 11 post-infection and viral p24 levels were measured. Replication of HIV-198IN22-N5-Mut was significantly reduced at day 11 post-infection in comparison to HIV-198IN22-WT (*, p<0.05) in the presence of MTb co-infection.
