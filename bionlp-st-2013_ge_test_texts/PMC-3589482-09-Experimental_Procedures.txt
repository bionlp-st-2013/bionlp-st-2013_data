Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays (MEF Cells)
Cebpb-/- MEFs (1x105) [34] were transfected with the indicated luciferase reporter plasmid (400 ng) along with a beta-actin-beta-galactosidase reporter plasmid (200 ng) by electroporation using the Invitrogen Neon(TM) system (1 pulse, 1350 V, 30 msec). Transfected cells were transferred to pre-warmed media in 24 well plates and incubated for 48 hrs prior to incubation with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 hrs where indicated. In some experiments, plasmids encoding C/EBP-beta or C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor mutants (T188A, T217A, S64A) [38]-[40] or control vector were co-transfected (0.6-1.0 microg total DNA). Luciferase activity was determined and normalized to that of beta-galactosidase [38] using the Luciferase Assay System and beta-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System Kits, respectively (Promega). Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and triplicate samples were employed for each sample. Expression of the C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor mutant proteins was checked for equal expression by western blot.
