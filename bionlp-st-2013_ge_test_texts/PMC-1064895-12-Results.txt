IL-17 production in PBMC from patients with RA, patients with OA and normal individuals
PBMC were separated and cultured with PHA (5 mug/ml) from patients with RA, patients with OA, and age-matched normal controls; IL-17 levels were then determined in the culture supernatants (Fig. 1). Although the amounts of basal IL-17 secretion were not different between RA, OA and normal controls (62 +/- 31, 43 +/- 19 and 43 +/- 10 pg/ml, respectively), the IL-17 production stimulated by PHA was significantly higher in RA PBMC than in those from OA and controls (768 +/- 295 versus 463 +/- 211 pg/ml [P < 0.05] and 241 +/- 29 pg/ml [P < 0.001]).
