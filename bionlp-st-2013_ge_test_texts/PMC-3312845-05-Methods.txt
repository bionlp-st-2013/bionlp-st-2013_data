Tissue processing
At designated time points (non-SE: 12 hr, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days and 1 week after SE; n = 5, for each time point), animals were perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4) under urethane anesthesia (1.5 g/kg, i.p.; Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO). The brains were removed, and postfixed in the same fixative for 4 hr. The brain tissues were cryoprotected by infiltration with 30% sucrose overnight. Thereafter, the entire hippocampus was frozen and sectioned with a cryostat at 30 mum and consecutive sections were contained in six-well plates containing PBS. For stereological study, every sixth section in the series throughout the entire hippocampus was used in some animals.
