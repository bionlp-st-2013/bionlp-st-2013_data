Phosphorylation of C/EBP-beta at Serine 64 negatively Regulates LPS-stimulated SerpinB2 Promoter Activity
Phosphorylation of C/EBP-beta is well recognized to modulate its transactivation potential [63]. To investigate C/EBP-beta phosphorylation sites that may be important for LPS-stimulated SerpinB2 proximal promoter activity (Fig. 8B), we co-expressed several C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor mutants in which the critical threonine or serine residue was mutated to an alanine, along with the pGLmP-539 murine SerpinB2 luciferase reporter in Cebpb-/- MEFs. Re-expression of wild-type C/EBP-beta in Cebpb-/- MEFs significantly stimulated SerpinB2 luciferase reporter gene expression in the presence of LPS by ~3 fold (Fig. 8C, left), confirming the importance of C/EBP-beta to LPS-induced SerpinB2 gene transcription. Expression of the C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor mutant, C/EBPbetaT217A, in Cebpb-/- MEFs did not significantly increase SerpinB2 promoter activity above that of wild-type C/EBP-beta (Fig. 8C, right); confirming that phosphorylation of C/EBP-beta at T217 is not a major factor in the regulation of SerpinB2 promoter activity in response to LPS.
C/EBP-beta contains additional phosphorylation sites, C/EBP-betaT188 and C/EBP-betaS64 (Fig. 8B), which may be involved in modulating C/EBP-beta-dependent SerpinB2 gene transcription. C/EBP-betaT188 is implicated in regulating DAPK1, an IFNgamma-inducible gene involved in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis [38], processes with which SerpinB2 has also been associated [17]. C/EBP-betaS64 is important for LPS-induced transcription of the cytokines IL-6 and MCP-1 [64]. Similarly, SerpinB2 is induced by LPS and regulated in a manner similar to cytokines [29]. Given the similarities in the functional significance of these phospho-specific isoforms of C/EBP-beta and SerpinB2, we investigated whether these phospho-acceptor sites may play a role in SerpinB2 gene expression. C/EBP-betaT188A-transfected MEFs exhibited SerpinB2 promoter activity similar to that of wild-type C/EBP-beta-transfected MEFs, whereas the expression of C/EBP-betaS64A potentiated SerpinB2 promoter activity in response to LPS (Fig. 8C, right). These data suggest that phosphorylation of C/EBP-beta at S64 acts to negatively regulate SerpinB2 proximal promoter activity.
