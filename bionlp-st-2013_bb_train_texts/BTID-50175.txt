Vibrio parahaemolyticus
Vibrio parahaemolyticus causes food-borne gastroenteritis
Vibrios are facultatively anaerobic bacteria that are metabolically similar to the Enterobacteriaceae. They are ubiquitous to oceans, coastal waters, and estuaries. Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a Gram-negative bacillus from same family as those that cause cholera. It naturally inhabits coastal waters and is present in higher concentrations during summer; it is a halophilic, or salt-requiring organism. Vibrio parahaemolyticus causes food-borne gastroenteritis, which inflames the stomach and small intestine. Most people recover completely from the illness by drinking plenty of fluids. The bacterial pathogen is a growing concern in North America, particularly in places where seafood is popular. Less commonly, this organism can cause an infection in the skin when an open wound is exposed to warm seawater.
