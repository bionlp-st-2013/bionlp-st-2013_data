Chlorobaculum parvum NCIB 8327
The phylum Chlorobi, which includes all known members of the green sulfur bacteria, is one of only six bacterial phyla that contain chlorophototrophic members. Chlorobi are Gram-negative organisms, and all known members are strictly anaerobic and strictly photoautotrophic. Most members oxidize sulfide or thiosulfate as electron donors for carbon dioxide fixation, although some can oxidize hydrogen or ferrous iron. Oxidation of sulfide leads to the extracellular deposition of sulfur globules, which are usually subsequently oxidized to sulfate. Most well characterized strains are capable of nitrogen fixation. In nature these organisms are important in the primary fixation of carbon and nitrogen in anoxic environments where sufficient sulfide and light exist to support their growth. These organisms are thus characteristically found in stratified lakes, microbial mats, and sulfide-rich hot springs. All known members produce a specialized light-harvesting antenna structure, the chlorosome, and Type 1 reaction centers, and all members synthesize bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) c, d or e as the major pigment molecule along with smaller amounts of BChl a and Chl a.

In order to provide a complete molecular description of the physiological and metabolic diversity of the members of the phylum Chlorobi, genome sequencing of the type strains of all described genera and species is in progress. The C. parvum genome was determined by pyrosequencing at The Pennsylvania State University in collaboration with Dr. Stephan C. Schuster. PCR and traditional Sanger sequencing were employed in gap closure, polishing and sequence verification. Initial analyses of the genomic data support the suggestion of Imhoff and colleagues (1, 2) that members of the genus Chlorobaculum are distinct and different from members of the genus Chlorobium.
