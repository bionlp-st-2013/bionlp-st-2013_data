Saccharophagus degradans 2-40
Description
Saccharophagus degradans strain 2-40. This strain is a marine gamma-proteobacterium that was isolated from decaying Spartina alterniflora, a salt marsh cord grass, in the Chesapeake Bay, USA. It is capable of degrading up to 11 insoluble complex carbohydrates through the collective action of enzyme complexes found on its cell surfaces, utilizing the degradation products as a carbon source. These include chitin, which constitute insect exoskeleton, plant cell wall components such as cellulose, and algal cell wall carbohydrates. This organism may be useful in bioremediation.
