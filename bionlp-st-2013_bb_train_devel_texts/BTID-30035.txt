Why sequence another Bacillus cereus strain?
Bacteria of the group cereus are ubiquitous and usually isolated from soil. However, these microorganisms are the real predators and from time-to-time can be isolated from dead insects or even animals, those deaths they were the cause.
Bacillus cereus is an acronym for the large group of bacteria which includes B. thuringiensis (insect killer), B. anthracis (animal killer), B. weihenstephanensis (able to grow in cold soil), B. mycoides (forming filaments). If no one of the above properties is detected, the Bacillus of this group is usually labeled by a neutral name B. cereus.
The bacteria of this group is now attracting increasing interest of researchers working on bacilli and other gram-positive bacteria. One of the fundamental and practical questions is how the ecological adaptation of these bacteria produces lines pathogenic for animals and insects (like B. anthracis or some B. thuringiensis lines). Intensive phylogenetic studies revealed the epidemic structure of this bacterial population. Some strains of B. cereus are non-hazardous (such strains are used as animal probiotics), other strains caused food poisoning, either emetic or diarrheic.

Gathering such data will certainly inspire new ideas about the short time evolution of these bacteria, which should allow scientists to predict, and if necessary to stop, its potential pathogenic emergence.
