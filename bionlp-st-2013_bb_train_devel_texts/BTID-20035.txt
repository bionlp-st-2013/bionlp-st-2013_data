Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN
Burkholderia phytofirmans strain PsJN T belongs to the beta-Proteobacteria (Sessitsch et al., 2005) and was isolated surface-sterilized Glomus vesiculiferum -infected onion roots (Nowak et al., 1997). Other strains belonging to this species have been isolated from soils and rhizospheres.
Cells are gram-negative, non-sporulating rods that grows in the presence of various sugars. The strain does not produce nitrate or nitrite. PsJN produces ACC deaminase activity probably contributing to the plant growth promoting abilities of the strain. It produces the quorum signaling compound 3-hydroxy-C8-homoserine lactone. Strain PsJN colonizes varios plants endophytically and in the rhizospheres and plant growth promotion have been reported with various plants such as potato, tomato, grapevine (Frommel et al., 1991; Nowak et al., 1995; Pillay and Nowak, 1997; Bensalim et al., 1998; Ait Barka et al., 2000; 2002; Compant et al., 2005).
