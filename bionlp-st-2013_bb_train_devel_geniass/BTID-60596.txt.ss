Spirillum
Description and Significance
Spirillum bacteria are thought to have been first described by van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670s and later by Muller.
S. volutans is a large bacterium as well as an obligate microaerophile with a helical structure.

Ecology
S. volutans has been found in the water of a cooling tower of a sugar-beet refinery in England and from water of a polluted pond.
It is thought that the bacterium can be found in many bodies of stagnant water.
