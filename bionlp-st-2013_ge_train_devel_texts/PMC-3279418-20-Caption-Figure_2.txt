Effect of Sharpin mutation on DC subpopulations and maturation.
(A) Spleens from WT and cpdm mice were isolated and subject to collagenase and DNase digestion. The obtained splenic homogenates were centrifuged over a Percoll gradient (35% and 55% density) for 15 minutes. The bands at the 35%-medium and the 35-55% interface were pooled, washed and stained with a combination of various antibodies to stain different DC subsets, conventional CD11c+CD8alpha+, CD11c+CD8alpha- and plasmacytoid DC (CD11c-PDCA-1+).The top panels were gated on FSChiSSClo cells to show separate populations of CD11c+PDCA-1- and CD11c-PDCA-1+ cells. Further gating on the CD11c+PDCA-1- subpopulation gave the bottom panel that showed two distinct pools of CD11c+CD8alpha+ and CD11c+CD8alpha- cells. Percentages were calculated based on the parental population and were additionally shown as bar graphs (n = 2) (B). (C) WT and cpdm BMDC (5x105) cells were stimulated with medium, 100 ng/ml LPS or 25 microg/ml poly I:C for 24 hours. The cells were labeled with PE-labeled anti-CD40, anti-CD80, and anti-CD86, and subjected to flow cytometry analysis. The populations shown in histograms were gated on CD11c+ cells. Unstained cells served as negative controls. Results are representative of two independent experiments.
