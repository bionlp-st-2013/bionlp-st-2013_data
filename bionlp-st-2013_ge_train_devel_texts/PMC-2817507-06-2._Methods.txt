2.5. Western Blots
Cellular proteins were prepared from ICH cerebral hemispheres, electrophoresed with SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto Hybond ECL membranes (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). The ECL membranes were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody (WuHan, BA1717) followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Golden Bridge, PV-6001). The signals were detected with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia). The same membranes were probed with anti-GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Biodesign, Saco, Maine) after being washed with stripping buffer. The signals were quantified by scanning densitometry and computer-assisted image analysis.
