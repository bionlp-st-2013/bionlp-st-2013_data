Isolation of PBMCs, CD4+ T cells, and culture conditions.
Human PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll (Biochrom) density gradient centrifugation and CD4+ T cells were then isolated using the Dynal CD4+ Isolation kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purity of CD4+ T cells was initially tested by flow cytometry and was >=95%. Cells were stimulated with the following combination of mAbs to T cell surface molecules (Meiler et al., 2008): anti-CD2 (clone 4B2 and 6G4; 0.5 microg/ml), anti-CD3 (clone OKT3; 0.5 microg/ml), and anti-CD28 mAb (clone B7G5; 0.5 microg/ml; all from Sanquin) and cultured in serum-free AIM-V medium (Life Technologies) with the addition of 1 nmol/liter IL-2 (Roche). TGF-beta (R&D Systems) was used at 5 ng/ml, if not stated otherwise. A combination of PMA (25 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was used.
Human CD4+ CD127- CD25high and CD4+ CD127+ CD25neg cells were purified by flow cytometry using anti-CD127, anti-CD25-PC5 (Beckman Coulter), and anti-CD4-FITC antibodies (Dako).
Mouse naive (CD62Lhi44lo25-) CD4+ T cells were purified by flow cytometry and activated in vitro with 5 microg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 and 1 microg/ml soluble anti-CD28 antibodies (eBioscience) in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS, 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics. Neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma and anti-IL-4 mAbs (BD) were used at 1 microg/ml concentrations when indicated.
