Plasmid Constructs
The Flag-IKKbeta (SSEE), Flag-IKKbeta (SSAA), and HA-IkappaBalpha (SSAA) constructs were provided by C. Wu (NCI, Bethesda) and U. Siebenlist (NIAID, Bethesda), respectively. The HA-IkappaBalpha and IKKbeta (K44A)-Flag plasmids were purchased from Addgene44, 45. The Flag-RPS3, GST-RPS3, HA-RPS3, VN-HA, NleH1-HA plasmids were described previously6, 9. The point mutants of RPS3 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick Change Kit (Stratagene) with primers forward 5'-CTGCCTGACCACGTGGCCATTGTGGAACCCAAA-3' and reverse 5'-TTTGGGTTCCACAATGGCCACGTGGTCAGGCAG-3' for S209A. All mutants were verified by DNA sequencing.
