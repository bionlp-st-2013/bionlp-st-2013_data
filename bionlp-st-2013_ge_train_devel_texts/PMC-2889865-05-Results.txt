NF-==kappa==B inhibition due to PKC-dependent Bcl10 degradation
Western blot analysis revealed an up-regulation of phosphorylated-PKC after 24 h treatment of Jurkat T-cells with PMA or HK E. coli (figure 7a), while I==kappa==B==beta== levels remained unaffected (figure 7b). Bcl10 is a signalling protein that acts upstream of NF-==kappa==B in concert with CARMA1 and MALT1 and has been suggested to directly regulate NF-==kappa==B activity in T-cells [27]. Therefore, Bcl10 activation was evaluated in both control and PMA stimulated cells after 10 min, 1 h, 6 h, and 24 h using western blot analysis. The Bcl10 levels decreased following treatment with PMA, while in control cells, Bcl10 returned to higher levels by 24 h (figure 7c). This suggests that Bcl10 is involved in the PMA dependent inhibition of NF-==kappa==B activation.
