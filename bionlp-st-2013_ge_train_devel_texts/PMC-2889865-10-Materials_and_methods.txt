Cell culturing, transfection and stimulation
Jurkat T-cells (wild type and TCR deficient- TCR-/-) were maintained in 90% RPMI 1640 medium (PAA laboratories, Austria) with 1.5 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen, USA), 10% foetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, USA) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen, USA) and incubated in a stable environment of 5% CO2 at 37degreesC.
The cells were centrifuged at 1000 x g for 8 min and resuspended in fresh media to a final cell density of 1.6 x 107 cells/ml in a 24-well plate. Reporter plasmid (pNFkappaB-Luc, pAP1 (PMA)-TA-Luc, pNFkappaB-SEAP), internal control plasmid (pRL) (Promega, USA) and lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) were added to each well at 0.54 mug/well, 0.06 mug/well and 1.5 mul/well, respectively. Initially, the reporter plasmid and pRL were mixed separately with OptiMEM (Gibco, USA). After 5 min of incubation at room temperature, lipofectamine 2000 was added and the mixture was incubated further for 20 min at room temperature. The transfection was allowed to proceed overnight at 37degreesC, after which, the cells were centrifuged, the media removed and fresh pre-warmed media added. The cells were pre-incubated with NF-kappaB, JNK and PKC inhibitors and stimulated in 24-well plates with different concentrations of PMA, HK E. coli MG1655 and Calcium Ionophore A23187.
The cells were lysed and luciferase activity (NF-kappaB and AP-1) was measured using the Dual-Luciferase(R) reporter assay system (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions on a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Secreted alkaline phosphatase (NFkappaB-SEAP, figure 4a, b) levels were measured using Great EscAPe(TM) SEAP Detection Kit (Clontech, USA).
