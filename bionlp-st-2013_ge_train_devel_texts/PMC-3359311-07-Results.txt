Bay11-7082 inhibits pro-IL-1beta production in response to P. aeruginosa
In addition to inhibition of NF-kappaB activity, Bay11-7082 can also directly inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome [38]. To validate its use in this study as an NF-kappaB inhibitor, western blots for pro-IL-1beta were performed alongside inhibition of CFTR activity by CFTRinh172 in response to PAO1 at 4 hours after stimulation (Fig. 7a). Our results indicate that Bay11-7082 prevents production of pro-IL-1beta whereas CFTRinh172 does not seem to affect it. This was further corroborated by the ability Bay11-7082 to inhibit IkappaBalpha degradation at 0.5, 1, and 1.5 hours post PAO1 stimulation (Fig. 7b).
