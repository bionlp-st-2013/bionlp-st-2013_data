RPS3 and IKKbeta interaction
The activation of the inhibitor of kappaB kinase (IKK), consisting of a regulatory subunit IKKgamma and two catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, is critical for the phosphorylation and dispatch of the inhibitory IkappaBs and the liberation of NF-kappaB20-22. Given that RPS3 can be found in the cytoplasmic p65-p50-IkappaBalpha inhibitory complex in resting cells6, we hypothesized that activated IKKbeta might also bind to and phosphorylate RPS3. First, we found that ectopically expressed IKKbeta and RPS3 interacted (Fig. 1c). We next examined resting Jurkat cells and detected a modest endogenous IKKbeta-RPS3 interaction (Fig. 1d), potentially accounting for the basal NF-kappaB transcription required for cell proliferation and survival. RPS3-IKKbeta association was clearly augmented upon TNF stimulation, peaking at 10 min. (Fig. 1d), following similar kinetics to RPS3 serine phosphorylation (Fig. 1b). By contrast, there was no detectable interaction between RPS3 and IKKalpha (Fig. 1d).
