PTX decreases LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation
Since phosphorylation leads to ubiquitination and degradation of I-kappaBalpha and subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, we first examined the effects of PTX on I-kappaBalpha. Cytoplasmic I-kappaBalpha phosphorylation was markedly increased following LPS stimulation when compared to control (100 +/- 0 vs. 20 +/- 18; P < 0.05). The addition of PTX significantly downregulated LPS-induced I-kappaBalpha phosphorylation (P = 0.02; Figure 2)
In a similar fashion, nuclear NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation was increased following LPS stimulation (100 +/- 0 vs. 38 +/- 20; P < 0.01). PTX similarly decreased LPS-induced NF-kappaB p65 nuclear phosphorylation, a marker of NF-kappaB activation and nuclear translocation (100 +/- 0 vs. 40 +/- 6; P =0.03; Figure 3A).
EMSAs were then performed to verify the PTX-induced alterations in nuclear phosphorylation resulted in similar effects on the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB. The addition of PTX to LPS-stimulated mononuclear cells resulted in comparable downregulation of DNA binding activity, similar to the observed downregulation of NF-kappaB phosphorylation (Figure 3B).
