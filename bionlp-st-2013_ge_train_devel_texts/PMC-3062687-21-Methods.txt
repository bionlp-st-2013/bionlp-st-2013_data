Immunofluorescence Microscopy
Confocal microscopy was performed as previously described6. Briefly, cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS and then Cellspin mounted onto slides. The fixed cells were then permeabilized with 0.05 % Triton X-100 in PBS and stained with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-RPS3 antibodies (Primm Biotech), or AlexaFluor 594-conjugated rat anti-Flag antibodies (BD) for 40 min together with 1 mug/ml of Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) for 5 min at 25 degreesC. The slides were then rinsed with PBS three times and cover mounted for fluorescence microscopy.
