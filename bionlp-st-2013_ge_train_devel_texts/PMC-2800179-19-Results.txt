Degraded CGN Induce I==kappa==B Degradation and NF-==kappa==B Activation
The expression of genes encoding for ICAM-1 and TNF-==alpha== is controlled by the nuclear factor NF-==kappa==B. Site-specific phosphorylation of the inhibitor I==kappa==B leads to its degradation by proteasome and to a consequential activation of the NF-==kappa==B pathway. Using a reporter plasmid for NF-==kappa==B activation, it was confirmed that dCGN induced a strong activation of NF-==kappa==B, as reflected by an increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 7A). Both forms of dCGN used induced NF-==kappa==B activation in a dose dependent manner. However, the effect was more strongly induced by the 40 kDa dCGN (Fig. 7A). These results were further confirmed by directly detecting NF-==kappa==B in the cell nucleus by Western blotting (Fig. 7C) and by FACS (Fig. 7D). These assays also allowed us to determine what NF-==kappa==B subunits were activated by dCGN. Both forms (10 or 40 kDa) of dCGN induced activation of the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-==kappa==B. This nuclear factor was present in low levels in the cell nucleus and increased considerably after treatment with dCGN. Western blots suggested the the 40 kDa form of dCGN induced a stronger activation of NF-==kappa==B (Fig. 7C). A more sentive assay for nuclear factor activation is flow cytometry of nuclei stained with specific antibodies for the nuclear factor of interest. In agreement with the previous data, FACS analysis of nuclei from THP-1 cells showed that there was a basal level of nuclear NF-==kappa==B (Fig. 7D). Again, both forms (10 or 40 kDa) of dCGN induced an increase of the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-==kappa==B in the nucleus of these cells. The 40 kDa degraded CGN gave a stronger increase of NF-==kappa==B (Fig. 7D). These data strongly suggest that the heterodimer p50/p65 is the NF-==kappa==B isoform activated by degraded CGN in monocytes. In addition, degradation of the inhibitor I==kappa==B==alpha== was also observed in cells treated with dCGN (Fig. 7B). No significant I==kappa==B==alpha== degradation was detected within two hours of dCGN treatment, but I==kappa==B==alpha== was markedly degraded by four hours of dCGN treatment (Fig. 7B). We focused on I==kappa==B==alpha== subunit, since it masks the nuclear localisation sequence of p65, it is the most rapidly degraded subunit and the most studied one.
