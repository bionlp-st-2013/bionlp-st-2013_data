Effect on MKP-1
Dexamethasone inhibits p38 MAPK function in a cell type-specific manner through the rapid induction of the dual kinase phosphatase MKP-1 (MAPK phosphatase-1), and this effect lasts for up to 24 h [28]. FP (10-8 M) treatment of HuT-78 cells activated by anti-CD3/CD28 in vitro significantly decreased p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Figure 3A) and activity measured by phosphorylation of the downstream target ATF-2 (Figure 3B). This effect was detected at 30 min and lasted for at least 14 h (Figure 3B). FP (10-8 M) also significantly reduced GATA-3 serine phosphorylation induced by anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Figure 3C). This reduction in GATA-3 phosphorylation was also seen with lower concentrations of FP. We found that FP significantly induced MKP-1 mRNA in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner, reaching a plateau at 10-8 M after 10 min (Figure 3D and 3E). However, the effects of FP on GATA-3 nuclear import, importin-alpha association and IL-4 mRNA expression are seen at 10,000-fold lower concentrations (10-12 M, see Figure 2).
Using an in vitro competition assay (Figure 4A) utilizing purified activated GATA-3, importin-alpha, and activated GR, we demonstrated that activated GR significantly increased GR-importin-alpha association in the presence and absence of activated GATA-3 (Figure 4B). This effect is not mutual, since activated GATA-3 did not block GR-importin-alpha association (Figure 4C). These data also suggest that both activated GR and phospho-GATA-3 can directly associate with importin-alpha (Figure 4D) and that activated GR attenuates the phospho-GATA-3/importin-alpha interaction in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4E). Together, this suggests that ligand-activated GR may compete with phospho-GATA-3 for importin-alpha and thereby limit GATA-3 nuclear import.
Other possible interpretations of our results could include an effect of FP on GATA-3 nuclear export and/or degradation. Leptomycin B, which inhibits nuclear export, did not affect the ability of FP to block GATA-3 nuclear localization (Figure 5A). Additionally, FP had no effect on whole cell GATA-3 expression during the time course of these experiments (Figure 5B). Nor did addition of FP subsequent to anti-CD3/CD28 nuclear translocation affect GATA-3 nuclear residency (Figure 5C), suggesting that activated GR does not enhance GATA-3 nuclear export. Finally, the effect of FP on GATA-3 nuclear import was not nonspecific, since FP (10-8 M) had no effect on p65 nuclear translocation measured at 60 min (Figure 5D).
