NF-==kappa==B inhibition by PMA correlated to PKC-dependent Bcl10 degradation. Levels of intracellular protein were assessed following 24 h stimulation with PMA (162 nM) or HK E. coli (5 x 107 CFU/ml). (A) Phospho-PKC increased in response to PMA and HK E. coli stimulation. (B) I==kappa==B decreased following stimulation with HK E. coli indicating NF-==kappa==B activation. (C) Bcl10 activation was inhibited following long-term stimulation with PMA, which explains the inhibitory effect of PMA on NF-==kappa==B activation. ==beta==-actin was used as a loading control. (n = 3).
