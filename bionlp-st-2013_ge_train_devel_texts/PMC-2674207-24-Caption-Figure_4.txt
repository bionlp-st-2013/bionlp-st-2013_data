Fluticasone propionate competes with phospho-GATA-3 for importin-alpha.
(A) schematic representation of the in vitro binding competition assay. (B) GR isolated from FP (10-8 M) stimulated cells enhances GR-importin-alpha binding in the presence (*) and absence (==blacksquare, square, filled==) of activated GATA-3. * p<0.05 compared to no activated GR. (C) GATA-3 isolated from anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated cells does not attenuate GR-importin-alpha association. *p<0.05 compared to control. (D) Activated GR blocks the ability of purified phospho-GATA-3 isolated from anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated cells interacting with immobilised importin-alpha in an in vitro binding assay. *p<0.05 compared to GATA-3 isolated from unstimulated cells. #p<0.05 compared to stimulated GATA-3-importin binding. (E) The effect of activated (*) versus unstimulated (o) GR on attenuation of GATA-3-importin-alpha association was concentration-dependent. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 between groups. All results are expressed as mean+/-SEM of three independent experiments and analysed by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test.
