The Effect of Corticosteroids on GATA-3 Nuclear Translocation and IL-4 mRNA
Corticosteroids are effective in inhibiting GATA-3-regulated IL-4 gene expression in vitro and in vivo [32]. We therefore investigated whether corticosteroids affect anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated nuclear import of GATA-3. Stimulation of cells with anti-CD3/CD28 resulted in a rapid cytoplasmic/nuclear GATA-3 translocation (Figure 1A), confirming our previous results [12]. We also confirmed a clear separation of nuclear and cytosolic fractions as indicated by histone H1 and MEK-1 markers (Figure 1B). The potent topical corticosteroid FP caused sustained loss of nuclear GATA-3 expression and cytoplasmic retention of GATA-3 at concentrations ranging from 10-12 to 10-8 M, which cover the therapeutic range [37]. This effect was concentration- and time-dependent, with a peak effect of 11.6-fold at 30 min at a concentration of 10-8 M (Figure 1C) and was associated with marked reductions in anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA expression (Figure 1D) and a loss of GATA-3 binding to the native IL-5 promoter (Figure 1E).
