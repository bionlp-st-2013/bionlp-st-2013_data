Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells by using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen); RNA aliquots (200 ng) were reverse transcribed using Random Examers (Roche) and Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time PCR was performed with the iQ Green Super mix (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and carried out with the iCycler iQ Real-Time detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories) under the following conditions: 95==degrees==C, 1 min; (94==degrees==C, 10 s; 60==degrees==C, 30 s) x40. Primers for Tat and MIP-1==alpha== are listed in Supplementary Data. Real-time PCR of CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA, TLR2, GAPDH and ACTB was performed using the RT2 profiler PCR Array-Human NF-==kappa==B signaling pathway (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, USA). Reactions were carried out in triplicate, and gene expression levels were calculated relative to GAPDH mRNA levels as endogenous control. Relative expression was calculated as 2(Ct gene under investigation - Ct GAPDH).
