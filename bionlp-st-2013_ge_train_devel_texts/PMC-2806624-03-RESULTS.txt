RUNX1 and RUNX3 bind to the FOXP3 promoter
Transcription element search system analysis of the human FOXP3 promoter predicted 3 putative RUNX binding sites at 333, 287, and 53 bp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS). All three binding sites are conserved between human, mouse, and rat (Fig. S4). To verify the putative binding sites in the FOXP3 promoter, we transiently transfected HEK293T cells with RUNX1 and RUNX3. After the pull-down with oligonucleotides containing the wild-type binding sequences, but not mutant sequences, RUNX binding to the FOXP3 promoter oligonucleotides was detected by Western blot (Fig. 3 A). To confirm these results and test the ability of single binding site sequences to bind either RUNX1 or RUNX3, we used the promoter enzyme immunoassay. Cell lysates were obtained from HEK293T cells that had been transiently transfected with RUNX1 or RUNX3 expression vectors. The biotinylated FOXP3 promoter oligonucleotides were linked to a streptavidin-coated microtiter plate, and bound RUNX1 or RUNX3 was detected by using anti-RUNX antibodies and a peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody. We showed binding of RUNX1 and RUNX3 to the mixture of all three oligonucleotides containing the binding sites, whereas there was no binding detectable when a combination of the mutated oligonucleotides was used in the assay (Fig. 3 B). Although there was a similar and high degree of binding to the -333 and -287 sites, a lower degree of binding was detected when the oligonucleotide containing the -53 site in the Foxp3 promoter was used. This effect was observed both for binding to RUNX1 and RUNX3 (Fig. 3 B). The binding to the two single binding sites at -333 and -287 was comparable to the mixture of all three oligonucleotides. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay results confirmed the binding of RUNX1 and RUNX3 complexes containing CBFbeta to FOXP3 promoter during the differentiation of naive T cells toward T reg cells. Here, naive CD4+ T cells were cultured with IL-2, anti-CD2/3/28 mAb, and TGF-beta as a Foxp3-inducing stimulation. Amplification of PCR products from the FOXP3 promoter region with the predicted RUNX binding sites showed that RUNX1, RUNX3, and CBFbeta were immunoprecipitated together with the FOXP3 promoter (Fig. 3 C). Negative control primer targeting open reading frame-free intergenic DNA, IGX1A did not show any significant change in site occupancy.
