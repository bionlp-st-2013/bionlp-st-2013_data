LMP1 Promotes B-1a Lymphomas That Can Escape Allelic Exclusion
(A) Flow cytometry analysis of splenocytes from a WT or LMP1 transgenic lymphoma for the pan-B cell (CD19), B-1a cell (CD5), and Ig heavy chain (IgM and IgD) and light chain (kappa and lambda) markers. Shown are the results from WT lymphoma 1 and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma 4. This analysis was repeated on four other LMP1 transgenic lymphomas (1, 2, 3, and 6) showing a similar B-1a phenotype, of which lymphomas 2 and 4 were also doubly positive for kappa and lambda light chains.
(B) Flow cytometry analysis of WT or LMP1 transgenic splenocytes for B-1a (CD19+CD5+) and B-1b or B2 subsets (CD19+CD5-). Percentages of B-1a and B-1b or B2 subsets are shown in each quadrant. This analysis was repeated on three other WT and two other LMP1 transgenic mice with similar results.
(C) Immunoblot analysis for kappa and lambda light chains of B cells (CD19+) purified from WT and LMP1 transgenic mice. Actin was used as a loading control.
