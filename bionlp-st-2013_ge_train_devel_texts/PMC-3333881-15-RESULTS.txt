Tat activates the p65-dependent expression of NF-kappaB-responsive genes, occupies the NF-kappaB enhancers and promotes the p65 recruitment with IkappaB-alpha displacement
We analysed the action of Tat on the expression of NF-kappaB-responsive genes in vivo. To this end, HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-Tat, FLAG-Tat C(22,25,27)A or FLAG-Tat R(49-57)A, and 48 h later the expression of a number of NF-kappaB-dependent genes was analysed by real-time PCR. Tat significantly increased the expression of MIP-1alpha, CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA and TLR2, while the mutants Tat C(22,25,27)A and Tat R(49-57)A were ineffective (Figure 5A-E). The Tat-dependent transactivation of the NF-kappaB-dependent genes was abolished when cells were transfected with siRNA p65, indicating that the Tat transcriptional activation was mediated by p65 (Figure 5A-E). Differently, the expression of the NF-kappaB-independent genes GAPDH and ACTB was unaffected by wild-type and Tat mutants (Figure 5F and G). These results were consistent with the requirement of both the cysteine-rich and arginine-rich domains of Tat to enhance the NF-kappaB activity, suggesting that the up-regulation of NF-kappaB-responsive genes by Tat might occur through physical interaction of the viral protein with p65 and IkappaB-alpha.
MIP-1alpha, which was the mostly activated gene by Tat, encodes for a chemokine that promotes the recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells (56). Consistently with our findings, MIP-1alpha expression was increased in glial cells and lymph nodes of AIDS patients (57,58); moreover, MIP-1alpha production was induced by HIV-1 infection (59,60) and Tat protein (57,61,62). The transcriptional regulation of MIP-1alpha has been poorly characterized. Jaspar-based analysis (http://jaspar.genereg.net/) predicted three putative NF-kappaB enhancers in the proximal promoter region of the MIP-1alpha gene: NF-kappaB1, -1023/-1014 nucleotides; NF-kappaB2, -661/-652 nucleotides; NF-kappaB3, +370/+379 nucleotides (Supplementary Figure S3A). To validate the predicted NF-kappaB binding sites of the MIP-1alpha promoter, we stimulated HeLa cells with TNF-alpha, a well-known NF-kappaB inducer, and measured the expression levels of MIP-1alpha by real-time PCR, and the p65 occupancy of the NF-kappaB sites by ChIP. TNF-alpha activated the expression of MIP-1alpha and induced the p65 recruitment to the NF-kappaB1 site of MIP-1alpha without affecting the occupancy of the putative NF-kappaB2 and NF-kappaB3 sites (Supplementary Figure S3B and S3C). Tat also promoted the recruitment of p65 to the NF-kappaB1 site of MIP-1alpha, while it did not affect the putative NF-kappaB2 and NF-kappaB3 sites (Supplementary Figure S3D). Altogether these results indicated that the NF-kappaB1 site was the only effective NF-kappaB enhancer of the MIP-1alpha promoter in response to TNF-alpha and Tat.
Similarly to MIP-1alpha, Tat increased the recruitment of p65 to the NF-kappaB enhancers of CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA and TLR2, while it was ineffective at the promoters of GAPDH and ACTB (Figure 5H). By ChIP, Tat bound to the NF-kappaB-responsive promoters, and not to the GAPDH and ACTB promoters, with loss of binding following p65 RNA interference (Figure 5I), suggesting that Tat occupancy occurred via p65 interaction. As additional findings, IkappaB-alpha was chromatin-immunoprecipitated at the NF-kappaB enhancers in absence of Tat, and it was significantly removed in presence of Tat, or following IkappaB-alpha RNA interference (Figure 5J), indicating that Tat displaced IkappaB-alpha from promoters.
