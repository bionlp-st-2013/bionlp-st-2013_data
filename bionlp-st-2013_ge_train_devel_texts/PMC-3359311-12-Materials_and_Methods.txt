CF and control subject PBMCs
The diagnosis of CF was established by typical clinical features, increased sweat chloride concentrations (>60 mmol/l), and detection of CF-inducing mutations. All patients with CF were clinically stable at the time of blood donation, and we excluded any subjects who were receiving systemic corticosteroids due to potential immunomodulatory activity. Control samples were provided by healthy adult volunteers. In previously published work we have demonstrated that TLR-mediated inflammatory responses are stable in humans from birth to 60 years old [63], therefore did not age-match the CF patients and control subjects. Peripheral blood was collected in sodium heparin tubes (BD Biosciences) and PBMCs were isolated using density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque(TM) Plus (GE Healthcare). The layer containing PBMCs was isolated, washed twice in PBS and resuspended in complete RPMI. Cells were enumerated by trypan blue exclusion using the Countess automated cell counter (Invitrogen). For derivation of macrophages from monocytes, monocytes were allowed to adhere to plastic for 2 hours in RPMI 1640 after which non-adherent cells were removed. Monocytes were allowed to differentiate in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% human AB serum for 10 days.
