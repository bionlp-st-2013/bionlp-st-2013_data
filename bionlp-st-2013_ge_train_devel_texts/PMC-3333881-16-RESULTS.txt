In HIV-1-infected monocytes Tat sustains the NF-kappaB activity and promotes the transcriptional activation of MIP-1alpha by interacting with IkappaB-alpha and p65
We next analysed whether Tat affected the NF-kappaB activity and the expression of MIP-1alpha in the course of HIV-1 infection. To detect the Tat protein, we produced HXB2 Env-pseudotyped NL4-3.FLAG-Tat.R-E- virions, which were used in single-round infection of U937, a human monocytic cell line. Cells were transfected with siRNA Tat, siRNA control or left untransfected to modulate the Tat expression, and then analysed for the kinetic of NF-kappaB activation following viral infection. The expression of Tat and p24 was detected at 3- to 12-h post-infection, while it was barely detected in siRNA Tat-transfected cells (Figure 6A).
The NF-kappaB activity, as measured by p65 DNA binding, was induced at 3-h post-infection in both Tat-positive (no siRNA and siRNA control) and Tat-negative cells (siRNA Tat), and increased at 12 h only in Tat-positive cells (Figure 6B). Degradation of IkappaB-alpha was observed at 3-h post-infection, and was followed by de novo synthesis of IkappaB-alpha at 12 h independently of the Tat presence (Figure 6C). Consistently, the IKK activity was induced at 3-h post-infection and turned off at 12 h independently of the Tat presence (Figure 6D). These results agreed with the kinetic of NF-kappaB activation in single-round HIV-1 infection of Jurkat cells (Figure 1), and further supported the requirement of viral expression to counteract the post-activation turn off of NF-kappaB.
In HIV-1-infected U937 cells, the endogenous Tat was coimmunoprecipitated with IkappaB-alpha and p65 (Figure 6E), and activated the MIP-1alpha expression in a p65-dependent manner, as shown by the lack of effect following RNA interference of Tat or p65 (Figure 6F). Moreover, Tat and p65 were both recruited to the NF-kappaB enhancer of MIP-1alpha, while the p65 occupancy was abolished by siRNA Tat (Figure 6G and H). Altogether these results indicated that in single round HIV-1 infection Tat associated with IkappaB-alpha and p65, and induced the p65-dependent activation of MIP-1alpha expression through occupancy of the MIP-1alpha promoter and increased recruitment of p65.
