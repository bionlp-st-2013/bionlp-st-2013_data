In vitro T cell differentiation.
CD4+ CD45RA+ magnetically sorted (CD45RO depletion with AutoMACS; Miltenyi Biotec) cells were stimulated with immobilized plate-bound anti-CD3 (1 microg/ml; OKT3; IgG1) and anti-CD28 (2 microg/ml). For Th1 differentiation conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 5 microg/ml anti-IL-4, and 25 ng/ml IL-12 (R&D Systems). For Th2 conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 25 ng/ml IL-4, and 5 microg/ml anti-IL-12 (R&D Systems). For T reg cell conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 5 ng/ml TGF-beta, 5 microg/ml anti-IL-12, 5 microg/ml anti-IL-4. For Th17 conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 20 ng/ml IL-6, 5 ng/ml TGF-beta, 20 ng/ml IL-23 (Alexis Biochemicals Corp.), 10 ng/ml IL-1beta, 5 microg/ml anti-IL-4, and 5 microg/ml anti-IL-12 were used. Proliferating cells were expanded in medium containing IL-2. The cytokine profile of these cells demonstrated that IFN-gamma is the predominant cytokine in Th1 cells, IL-4 and IL-13 in Th2 cells, and IL-17 in Th17 cells (Akdis et al., 2000; Burgler et al., 2009).
