NF-==kappa==B activation is required for IL-1==beta== and IL-8 responses to P. aeruginosa
We confirmed the dependence of PAO1-induced IL-1==beta== and IL-8 production on NF-==kappa==B activation using THP-1 cells expressing a reporter driven by NF-==kappa==B and AP-1 response elements. We found that stimulation of primed THP-1 reporter cells with heat-killed PAO1 produced the highest levels of NF-==kappa==B/AP-1 activation (Fig. 6a) and this correlated with IL-8 secretion (Fig. 6b) but negligible amounts of IL-1==beta== were secreted (Fig. 6c). Stimulation of primed THP-1 reporter cells with live PAO1 did not significantly increase NF-==kappa==B/AP-1 activity (Fig. 6a) or IL-8 secretion (Fig. 6b) over priming alone. However, IL-1==beta== production was greatly augmented over primed cells stimulated with heat-killed PAO1 or unprimed cells stimulated with live PAO1 (Fig. 6c). This confirmed that NF-==kappa==B activation alone is not sufficient for maximal IL-1==beta== secretion, but increased priming of NF-==kappa==B is capable of augmenting IL-1==beta== production and secretion upon inflammasome stimulation. Dependency of these responses on NF-==kappa==B was confirmed by pharmacologic inhibition of NF-==kappa==B using the Bay11-7082 inhibitor of I==kappa==B==alpha== phosphorylation, which significantly reduced NF-==kappa==B/AP-1 activation (P==lt==0.001) (Fig. 6d) and the subsequent production of IL-8 (P==lt==0.01) (Fig. 6e) and IL-1==beta== (P==lt==0.001) (Fig. 6f) in response to both heat-killed and live PAO1. These results were also verified in CF and control PBMCs for each inflammasome examined (P==lt==0.001) (Fig. 6g-h). Overall these results confirm that NF-==kappa==B is an important modulator of IL-1==beta== production and that increased activation of NF-==kappa==B augments inflammasome-mediated production of IL-1==beta==.
