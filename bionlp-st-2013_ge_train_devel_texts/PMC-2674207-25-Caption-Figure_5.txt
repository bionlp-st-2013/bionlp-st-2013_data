Fluticasone propionate does not affect GATA-3 nuclear export.
(A) Western blot analysis showing that the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (2 nM) does not affect the ability of FP (10-8 M) to prevent anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated GATA-3 nuclear localization measured at 60 min. ***p<0.001 compared to unstimulated cells, ###p<0.001 compared to anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated cells. (B) Western blot analysis showing that FP (10-8 M) does not affect whole-cell GATA-3 degradation over 17 h. (C) GFP-tagged GATA-3 is overexpressed and cells stimulated (b-j) or not (a) with anti-CD3/CD28. The effect of treating cells with FP (10-8 M, f-j) after 30 min stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 is also shown. (D) FP (10-8 M) does not prevent anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated p65 nuclear translocation at 60 min after stimulation. **p<0.01 compared to unstimulated cells. All results are representative of at least four independent experiments and are shown as mean+/-SEM. Results were analysed by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test.
