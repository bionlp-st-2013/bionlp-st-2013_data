Animals, Chemicals and Diet
Male Wistar rats (150 g average weight) were housed under standard conditions and fed ad libitum with standard rodent laboratory chow. Degraded iota-carrageenans were administered in the drinking water (5% w/v) for 55 days to 2 groups of six animals each. The first group received the low molecular weight carrageenan (10 kDa dCGN) and the second received the medium molecular weight carrageenan (40 kDa dCGN). An additional group of four rats were maintained on regular tap water (control group). To increase palatability 0.2% sucrose was added to the drinking water of all groups (Van der Waaji et al., [23]). Fresh carrageenan solutions were prepared daily.
