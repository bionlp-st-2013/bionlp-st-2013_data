Inhibition of PKC reduces NF-kappaB activity in M-CSF stimulated macrophages.
(A) Human MDMs transfected with pNF-kappaB-SEAP were pre-incubated with inhibitors; Ro-31-8220, Go-6976, or BAPTA/AM for 30 minutes prior to 6 hours M-CSF stimulation. (B) RAW 264.7 cells transfected with the pNF-kappaB-SEAP construct were pre-incubated with inhibitors for 30 minutes prior to 2 hours of stimulation with mouse recombinant M-CSF. The NF-kappaB activity was analyzed by measuring SEAP production in the medium and data are expressed as fold increase of SEAP activity over that in pTAL-SEAP transfected resting cells. The graph represents mean +/- S.E.M for three independent experiments. *The p-values of cells treated with inhibitors/M-CSF compared to vehicle/M-CSF were <=0.05.
