Degraded CGN stimulated ICAM-1 expression in monocytes.
Peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) or THP-1 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of carrageenan for 24 h before being stained for various cell surface antigens. Antigen expression was then analyzed by flow cytometry. A: Histograms of ICAM-1 expression in cells treated with medium only (control), 10 kDa dCGN (C10), or 40 kDa dCGN (C40). B: Fluorescence intensity for expression of the antigens HLA-ABC, HLA-DR, CD14, ICAM-1, and CD58 in cells treated with medium only (control), 10 kDa dCGN (C10), or 40 kDa dCGN (C40). Data are mean +/- SEM.
