Human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat activates NF-==kappa==B via physical interaction with I==kappa==B-==alpha== and p65
Nuclear factor (NF)-==kappa==B is a master regulator of pro-inflammatory genes and is upregulated in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection. Mechanisms underlying the NF-==kappa==B deregulation by HIV-1 are relevant for immune dysfunction in AIDS. We report that in single round HIV-1 infection, or single-pulse PMA stimulation, the HIV-1 Tat transactivator activated NF-==kappa==B by hijacking the inhibitor I==kappa==B-==alpha== and by preventing the repressor binding to the NF-==kappa==B complex. Moreover, Tat associated with the p65 subunit of NF-==kappa==B and increased the p65 DNA-binding affinity and transcriptional activity. The arginine- and cysteine-rich domains of Tat were required for I==kappa==B-==alpha== and p65 association, respectively, and for sustaining the NF-==kappa==B activity. Among an array of NF-==kappa==B-responsive genes, Tat mostly activated the MIP-1==alpha== expression in a p65-dependent manner, and bound to the MIP-1==alpha== NF-==kappa==B enhancer thus promoting the recruitment of p65 with displacement of I==kappa==B-==alpha==; similar findings were obtained for the NF-==kappa==B-responsive genes CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA and TLR2. Our results support a novel mechanism of NF-==kappa==B activation via physical interaction of Tat with I==kappa==B-==alpha== and p65, and may contribute to further insights into the deregulation of the inflammatory response by HIV-1.
