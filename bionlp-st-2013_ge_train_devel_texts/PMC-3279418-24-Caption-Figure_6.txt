Inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling in cpdm BMDC.
WT and cpdm BMDC (2x106 cells in 0.5 mL complete medium) were stimulated with 100 ng/mL LPS (A) or 25 microg/mL poly I:C (B). At 0, 15, 30, and 60 minutes, whole-cell lysates were obtained and subject to immunoblots with antibodies against proteins involved in NF-kappaB, TBK1/IRF3, ERK1/2, and p38 signaling pathways. Beta-actin was used as loading control. (C) Cellular levels of p-IKK1/2 and p-IkappaBalpha in LPS- or poly I:C-stimulated BMDC were quantitated with ImageJ (NIH) and presented as trend lines. Results are representative of at least two independent experiments.
