RT-PCR Analysis
Total RNA from monocytes was isolated using TRIzol Reagent(TM) (Invitrogen). cDNA was generated on 1 microg of total RNA in a reaction volume of 20 microl, using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was done in the linear range of amplification (determined for each primer pair-cDNA combination). Standard PCR reactions were performed with 1 microl of the cDNA solution, 50 microM of each primer solution, 10 mM of each dNTP, 25 mM MgCl2, 10X Goldstar DNA polymerase reaction buffer, and 0.5 units of Goldstar DNA polymerase (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). First PCR cycle consisted of 1 min at 92degreesC, 1 min at 58degreesC and 1 min at 72degreesC; then each PCR cycle consisted of 40 sec at 92degreesC, 40 sec at 58degreesC and 50 sec at 72degreesC. cDNA for beta-actin was amplified for 28 cycles using the oligos: sense 5'-GGCATCGTGATGGACTCCG-3' and antisense 5'GCTGGAAGGTGGACAGCGA-3'. cDNA for TNF-alpha was amplified for 35 cycles using the oligos: sense 5'-AAGCCTGTAGCCCATGTTGT-3' and antisense 5'-CAGATAGATGGGCTCATACC-3'. cDNA for ICAM-1 was amplified for 35 cycles using the oligos sense 5'-GTAGCAGCCGCAGTCATAATGG-3' and antisense 5'-A TGCTGTTGTATCTGACTGAGG-3'.
