IL-10 Production by Th2 and Th17 Cells Also Requires ERK1 and ERK2 Activation
To address whether IL-10 production by Th2 and Th17 cells was also dependent on ERK1 and ERK2 activation, we differentiated these cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the absence of APCs (Shoemaker et al., 2006; Veldhoen et al., 2009; Veldhoen et al., 2006), in the presence or absence of the MEK inhibitor (PD184352). We showed that ERK1 and ERK2 activation is a common pathway required for induction of IL-10 in different Th cell subsets because IL-10 production by both Th2 and Th17 cells was markedly inhibited in the presence of the MEK inhibitor (PD184352) (Figure 5D and Figure S5B). In contrast, inhibitors of p38 MAPK or of GSK-3beta activation did not affect the expression of IL-10 by these subsets (Figure S5B). Activation of the ERK1 and ERK2 signaling pathway is therefore a common requirement for the induction of IL-10 production by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells.
