Quantitative PCR
The mRNA expression levels were determined by SYBR Green-based real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems, www.appliedbiosystems.com). The reaction conditions were 95==degrees==C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95==degrees==C for 15 sec and 60==degrees==C for 1 min. The results were normalized using ==beta==-actin mRNA as an internal control and expressed as relative values.
