PKC Inhibition Reduces NF-kappaB Activity in Human MDMs and RAW 264.7 Cells
Since NF-kappaB is activated by PKC in several cell types [36], we next determined if M-CSF-induced NF-kappaB transcriptional activity was dependent on PKC activation and if calcium, a co-factor for conventional PKC isoform activation, was important. In addition, because of the number of conventional PKCs existing within mononuclear cells, pharmacological inhibitors of PKC family activation was used to determine the relationship of PKC activation to M-CSF-induced cellular survival. MDMs were transfected with the pNF-kappaB-SEAP reporter and then treated with the general PKC inhibitor, Ro-31-8220; the conventional PKCalpha/beta inhibitor Go-6976; or the intracellular calcium blocker BAPTA/AM. Ro-31-8220 significantly suppressed M-CSF-induced NF-kappaB activity compared to cells treated with M-CSF alone (Figure 2A). In addition, Go-6976 and BAPTA/AM also blocked NF-kappaB activity in M-CSF-treated MDMs. Trypan blue exclusion analysis did not indicate cell death suggesting that this suppression was not due to non-specific toxicity. These data indicate that M-CSF mediated NF-kappaB activation through calcium-dependent conventional PKC activation.
We next investigated whether PKC inhibition affected NF-kappaB activity in the mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. Similar to MDMs, PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220, Go-6976 and BAPTA/AM reduced M-CSF-induced NF-kappaB activity in a dose-dependent manner in RAW 264.7 macrophages (Figure 2B). To ensure that PKC specifically regulated NF-kappaB p65 and not the closely related family member, c-Rel, we co-transfected c-Rel and NF-kappaB-SEAP constructs into the Raw 264.7 cell line and measured NF-kappaB activity in response to M-CSF. There was no increased NF-kappaB activity in cells expressing c-Rel (Figure S1). These observations indicate that PKC functioned upstream of NF-kappaB p65 in MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells.
