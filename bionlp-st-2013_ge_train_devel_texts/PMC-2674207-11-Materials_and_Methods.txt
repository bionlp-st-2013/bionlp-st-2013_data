GATA-3-GFP Construct
The GATA-3 clone (BC003070) complete cDNA was obtained from Invitrogen Life Technologies as a 5'- EcoRI/3'-XhoI insert of GATA-3 in the pOTB7 vector. GATA-3 was excised from pOTB7 using XhoI digestion and pEGFP-C2 (Clontech, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) was digested with BamHI. DNA was recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and both the GATA-3 fragment and the pEGFP-C2 vector blunt-ended by incubation with Klenow (Bioline Bio-27029) for 30 min at 37degreesC. Klenow was inactivated by incubation for 10 min at 75degreesC. DNA was recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and both the blunt-ended GATA-3 fragment and the GFP vector were subsequently digested with EcoRI before the 5'-EcoRI/3'-blunt end GATA-3 fragment was inserted into the 5'-EcoRI/3'-blunt ended GFP vector. Positive clones were confirmed by digestion and size analysis by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and by sequencing.
