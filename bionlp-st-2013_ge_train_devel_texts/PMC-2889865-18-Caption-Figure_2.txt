NF-kappaB down-regulation by PMA and up-regulation by heat killed E. coli MG1655 following long-term stimulation. Transfection of Jurkat T-cells was performed using luciferase reporter plasmids containing NF-kappaB cis-elements. (A) Time-dependent stimulation of Jurkat T-cells using PMA. NF-kappaB activation was evaluated using HK E. coli in a (B) dose- and (C) time-dependant manner. Calcium ionophore increased NF-kappaB activity following PMA exposure (E) and resulted in a negative regulation in response to HK E. coli stimulation (D). Statistical significance from the control was determined using Student's t-test. (n = 4). Controls were arbitrarily set to 1.
