Monocytes are produced in the bone marrow and circulate in blood for 24-48 hours [1]. In the absence of serum, monocytes die via apoptosis [1], [2]. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) stimulates mononuclear phagocyte survival and differentiation [3]. Importantly, M-CSF-mediated cell survival and activation is associated with a variety of human diseases, including atherosclerosis, transplant vascular sclerosis and breast cancer metastasis [4], [5], [6].
We previously identified that NF-kappaB activation is important in M-CSF-induced monocyte survival [7]. In addition to its role in mononuclear phagocyte survival, the transcription factor NF-kappaB regulates numerous genes that play important roles in cellular signaling, stress response, cell growth, survival, differentiation and inflammation [8]. There are five members in the NF-kappaB family: RelA/p65, p50, p52, c-Rel and RelB. The most common activating complex is the p50/p65 heterodimer, driven by the activation domain in the NF-kappaB p65 subunit. NF-kappaB p65 regulates important developmental processes [9], [10]. Mice lacking NF-kappaB p65 die in utero and have extensive liver damage via enhanced apoptosis [9]. Embryonic macrophages from NF-kappaB p65 null mice are susceptible to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis which is rescued by overexpressing the NF-kappaB p65 subunit [10]. Moreover, inhibiting NF-kappaB induces cell death in many cell types and cytokine-independent survival is mediated by constitutively active NF-kappaB in murine macrophages [11].
In monocytes and macrophages, NF-kappaB is an important transcriptional factor for expression of cytokines and cell surface receptors [12]. However, unlike resting T-cells, NF-kappaB is constitutively present in the nuclei of primary monocytes and monocytic cell lines in the absence of exogenous stimuli as demonstrated by mobility shift analysis [13]. Similarly, constitutively active NF-kappaB was observed in human alveolar macrophages [14].
In the classic/canonical pathway, the NF-kappaB p50/p65 complex is sequestered in the cytosol by IkappaBalpha [15]. Upon stimulation by cytokines or UV radiation, IkappaBalpha is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded, releasing NF-kappaB p50/p65 to translocate to the nucleus and transactivate target genes. After its release from IkappaBalpha, NF-kappaB p65 can undergo post-translational modification to activate gene transcription. The role of NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation on NF-kappaB transcriptional activity varies by stimulus, time of stimulation and cell type [16]. Previous research shows that phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 at Ser276, Ser529 or Ser536 plays an important role in regulating transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB [17]. In TNFalpha-treated murine fibroblasts, Ser276 of NF-kappaB p65 is phosphorylated by MSK1 to enhance NF-kappaB transcriptional activity [18]. In macrophages treated with endotoxin, NF-kappaB transcription activity is associated with phosphorylation on Ser276 and Ser536 that is regulated through protein kinase A (PKA) and IKKbeta respectively[16], [19]. In human T cells, NF-kappaB p65 is constitutively phosphorylated on Ser536 to facilitate NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation following cellular stimulation [20]. Accumulating evidence reveals that NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation at Ser276 is crucial for its transcriptional activity. Upon nuclear translocation, phosphorylation of Ser276 on NF-kappaB p65 by PKA recruits the transcription co-activator, p300 to potentiate NF-kappaB-regulated gene transcription [21]. However, other studies show that PKA inhibits NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression by stabilizing IkappaBalpha [22], [23]. Interestingly, the serine/threonine kinase Pim-1 directly phosphorylates NF-kappaB p65 at Ser276 by stabilizing to prevent ubiquitin-proteasome degradation [24]. Several other phosphorylation sites are also described to enhance NF-kappaB gene transactivation [25].
Here, we investigate the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in M-CSF-stimulated NF-kappaB activation. PKC proteins are multifunctional kinases that differ in structure, function and co-factor requirement [26]. PKCs are involved in diverse cell responses, including cell growth, survival, differentiation and development [27]. The 12 closely related enzymes of the PKC family are divided into three classes: conventional (cPKCs: alpha betaI betaII and gamma require Ca2+ and diacylglycerol (DAG); novel (nPKCs: delta, epsilon, eta, theta and mu) require DAG; and atypical (aPKCs: xi, iota and lambda) require neither Ca2+ nor DAG. Monocytes and macrophages predominantly express conventional PKC isoforms (PKCalpha PKCbetaI and PKCbetaII) and novel PKCs (PKCdelta and PKCepsilon). Conventional PKCs regulate differentiation of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 to macrophages [28]. PKCalpha induces IL-1alpha, iNOS and TNFalpha mRNA production after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure [29]. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that conventional PKCs like PKCalpha have anti-apoptotic functions. For example, PKCalpha is overexpressed in a variety of tumor cells including gliomas, liver, and lung [30], [31]. In epithelial cells, inhibition of PKCalpha induces PKCdelta-dependent apoptosis [31]. Interestingly, in human monocytes and premonocytic THP-1 leukemia cells, novel PKCs like PKCdelta have the opposite effect on cell survival, Voss et al showed that PKCdelta directly phosphorylates caspase-3 and promotes etoposide-induced apoptosis [32]. Moreover, knockout mouse studies suggest that another novel PKC, PKCepsilon is critically involved in early LPS-mediated signaling in activated macrophages [33].
Previously, we reported that M-CSF promotes monocyte survival through the activation of the PI3-K/AKT pathway [3]. In addition to AKT activation, M-CSF stimulates PKC in human monocytes and increases NF-kappaB DNA binding [34]. However, whether PKC and/or NF-kappaB activation is critical in M-CSF-stimulated mononuclear phagocyte survival and/or differentiation is unclear. In other cells, PKC plays an important role in NF-kappaB activation and cell survival [35], however the specific mechanisms of this activation and the biological effects on cellular phenotype are not known. Therefore, we focused at understanding the role of PKC in the regulation of NF-kappaB activation and M-CSF-induced monocyte survival.
Here we demonstrates that M-CSF upregulated the NF-kappaB transcription and cell survival in human and mouse macrophages. This activity was reduced by the conventional, but not novel, PKC inhibitors, dominant negative PKCalpha constructs or PKCalpha siRNA. Conventional PKC regulated NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression and phosphorylation of Ser276 of NF-kappaB p65 occurred in an M-CSF-dependent fashion correlating with its maximal transcriptional activity. Furthermore, PKCalpha-regulated phosphorylation of Ser276 of NF-kappaB p65 plays an important role in regulating its activity in mononuclear phagocytes and murine embryonic fibroblasts.
