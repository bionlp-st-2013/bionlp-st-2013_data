NF-kappaB activation is required for IL-1beta and IL-8 responses to P. aeruginosa
We confirmed the dependence of PAO1-induced IL-1beta and IL-8 production on NF-kappaB activation using THP-1 cells expressing a reporter driven by NF-kappaB and AP-1 response elements. We found that stimulation of primed THP-1 reporter cells with heat-killed PAO1 produced the highest levels of NF-kappaB/AP-1 activation (Fig. 6a) and this correlated with IL-8 secretion (Fig. 6b) but negligible amounts of IL-1beta were secreted (Fig. 6c). Stimulation of primed THP-1 reporter cells with live PAO1 did not significantly increase NF-kappaB/AP-1 activity (Fig. 6a) or IL-8 secretion (Fig. 6b) over priming alone. However, IL-1beta production was greatly augmented over primed cells stimulated with heat-killed PAO1 or unprimed cells stimulated with live PAO1 (Fig. 6c). This confirmed that NF-kappaB activation alone is not sufficient for maximal IL-1beta secretion, but increased priming of NF-kappaB is capable of augmenting IL-1beta production and secretion upon inflammasome stimulation. Dependency of these responses on NF-kappaB was confirmed by pharmacologic inhibition of NF-kappaB using the Bay11-7082 inhibitor of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, which significantly reduced NF-kappaB/AP-1 activation (P<0.001) (Fig. 6d) and the subsequent production of IL-8 (P<0.01) (Fig. 6e) and IL-1beta (P<0.001) (Fig. 6f) in response to both heat-killed and live PAO1. These results were also verified in CF and control PBMCs for each inflammasome examined (P<0.001) (Fig. 6g-h). Overall these results confirm that NF-kappaB is an important modulator of IL-1beta production and that increased activation of NF-kappaB augments inflammasome-mediated production of IL-1beta.
