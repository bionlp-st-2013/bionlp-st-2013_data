Immunofluorescence Staining
Immunofluorescence staining was performed as previously described [34]. All staining was performed at room temperature and under humidification. Cells were collected and cytospins prepared in a cytocentrifuge (Shandon II, Shandon, Runcorn, UK). Cells were permeabilized, blocked, and then incubated with GR (1:50 E-20 Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-GATA-3 (H-48; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were incubated with tetrarhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Dako). Cytospins were counterstained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI), a fluorescent blue nuclear indole chromatin stain, and mounted in PBS:glycerol (50:50). The immunopositive signal was characterised using laser scanning confocal microscopy on a Leica TCS NT/SP interactive laser cytometer equipped with confocal optics (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). To determine the specificity of the antibodies, rabbit serum immunoglobulin (Dako) and secondary antibodies without the primary were used as controls. Positively stained nuclei and total cells were counted (500) on each slide with the observer blinded to the treatment.
