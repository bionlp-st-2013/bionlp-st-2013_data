IL-4 Inhibits TGF-beta-Mediated iTreg Commitment
IL-4 induces differentiation of naive T cells, upon antigen encounter, into the Th2 cell lineage. We therefore asked whether IL-4 is able to inhibit TGF-beta induction of FOXP3 during the priming of naive T cells. Human CD4+CD45RA+ T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence of TGF-beta and/or IL-4 and harvested after 5 d. IL-4 efficiently repressed the TGF-beta-mediated induction of FOXP3 expression (Figure 5A) in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 5B). Low levels of GATA3 were induced also in the absence of IL-4, as it was previously observed [3]. However, at low concentration, IL-4 was able to marginally induce FOXP3 expression. Of note, GATA3 was also induced in the presence of TGF-beta at high IL-4 concentration (Figure 5A and 5B). The IL-4-mediated prevention of FOXP3 expression was not caused by interferences of the receptor signaling, because the phosphorylation of SMAD2 or STAT6 was not affected by the addition of IL-4 and/or TGF-beta, which demonstrates that IL-4 as well as TGF-beta signaling were functional under these conditions (Figure 5C). Increasing amounts of IL-4 increase intracellular GATA3, whereas FOXP3 decreased, which is consistent with the mRNA analysis (Figure 5D). Furthermore, injection of IL-4 into wild-type B6 mice decreased the inducible or natural Treg number in vivo. A distinction of the Treg subsets is not possible, because recently activated iTreg cells also express surface CD25. We used complexes of recombinant mouse IL-4 (rmIL-4) plus anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which have been shown to dramatically increase the potency of the cytokine in vivo [19]. In these mice, the percentage of CD4+CD25+ and FOXP3+ T cells dramatically decreased when the antibody-cytokine immune complexes were injected (Figure S2). Upon administration of rmIL-4 plus anti-IL-4 mAb complexes, the total number of CD4+CD25+ T cell, as well as the Foxp3+ T cells diminished by half (Figure S2G and S2H), confirming that the lower percentage was not due to an increase in the CD4+CD25- cells, but a real decrease of CD4+CD25+ T cells. In conclusion, IL-4 negatively regulates the natural or inducible Treg cell turnover not only in vitro but also in vivo. To study the effects of IL-4 on already-existing human natural or inducible Treg cells, we exposed sorted CD25+ T cells (nTreg cells) to IL-4 and analyzed FOXP3 expression and suppressive capacity. In already-existing Treg cells, IL-4 failed to inhibit FOXP3 expression (Figure S3A), and the suppressive capacity was not altered (Figure S3C). Similarly pre-existing iTreg cells did not decrease FOXP3 expression upon IL-4 exposure (Figure S3B).
