Immunoblots
After adding stimulating ligands, 100 ng/mL LPS or 25 microg/mL poly I:C, BMDC were collected and lysed at 0-, 15-, 30-, and 60-minute time points. Immunoblots were performed with antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) against p-IKK1/2(#2697), p-IkappaBalpha (#9246), IkappaBalpha (#4814), p-TBK1(#5483), p-p38 (#9216), p38 (#9212), p-ERK1/2 (#4376), and ERK1/2 (#4695). Beta-actin (sc-47778, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as loading control.
