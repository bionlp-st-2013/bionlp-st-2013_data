Production of proinflammatory mediators by cpdm BMDC is impaired
Incubation with LPS or poly I:C resulted in secretion of IL6, IL12P70, and GMCSF from both WT and cpdm BMDC; however, BMDC from cpdm mice produced significantly less of all three cytokines compared with WT BMDC (Fig. 3A-C, E-F). The amount of nitric oxide generated by mutant BMDC was also significantly reduced compared with WT cells (Fig. 3D), indicating severely disrupted production of proinflammatory mediators from Sharpin-deficient BMDC. In vivo complementation with a Sharpin gene-containing BAC reversed the phenotype of the mutant mice [2], and BMDC generated from these rescued mice secreted significantly more IL12P70 than BMDC from cpdm mice (Fig. 3G), supporting a necessary role of SHARPIN for the production of IL12P70. In addition, the transcript levels of the inflammatory cytokines Il6, Il12p40, Gmcsf, and Ifnb were examined, and these were all significantly reduced in stimulated cpdm BMDC when compared with WT controls (Fig. 4).
