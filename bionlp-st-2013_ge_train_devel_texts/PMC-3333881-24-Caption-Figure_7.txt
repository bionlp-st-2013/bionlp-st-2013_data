Model of MIP-1alpha transcriptional activation by HIV-1 Tat. (A) In absence of Tat, IkappaB-alpha occupies the NF-kappaB enhancer of the MIP-1alpha promoter and likely interacts with transcriptional repressors, such as HDACs (65), to inhibit gene transcription. (B) Tat activates the MIP-1alpha expression by removing the IkappaB-alpha repressor from the NF-kappaB enhancer, and by increasing the binding of p65 NF-kappaB complex to the NF-kappaB enhancer.
