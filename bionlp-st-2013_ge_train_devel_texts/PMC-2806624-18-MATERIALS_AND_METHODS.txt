Flow cytometry.
For analysis of human FOXP3 expression on the single-cell level, cells were first stained with the monoclonal CD4 mAb (Beckman Coulter), and after fixation and permeabilization, they were incubated with anti-human Foxp3-Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (BioLegend) based on the manufacturer's recommendations and subjected to FACS (EPICS XL-MCL; Beckman Coulter). A mouse IgG1 antibody (BioLegend) was used as an isotype control. Data were analyzed with the CXP software (Beckman Coulter). Cells were cultured with IL-2, and then left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-CD2/-CD3/-CD28 mAb.
Flow cytometry analyses of the mouse cells were performed on an LSRII (BD) and cell sorting was performed on a FACSAria (BD). All antibodies for these experiments were purchased from eBioscience or BD.
