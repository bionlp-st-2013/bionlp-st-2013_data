PCR analysis of ==kappa== chain rearrangement.
DNA was isolated from splenocytes using the Dneasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen), with Rnase treatment. PCR reactions contained 100 ng of genomic DNA, 0.2 ==mu==M each primer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, and 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (NEB) performed in 1X ThermoPol buffer (NEB). Primers used were V==kappa==con and J==kappa==5-1==degrees== and have been described previously [74]. PCR conditions were 94 ==degrees==C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 94 ==degrees==C for 30 s, 63 ==degrees==C for 90 s, and 72 ==degrees==C for 1 min, followed by 1 cycle of 72 ==degrees==C for 5 min.
