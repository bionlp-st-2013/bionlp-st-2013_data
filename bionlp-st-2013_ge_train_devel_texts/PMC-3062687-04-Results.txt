IKKbeta is required for RPS3 nuclear translocation
To examine whether the RPS3-IKKbeta interaction is required for RPS3 nuclear translocation, we knocked down IKKalpha or IKKbeta expression with siRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 1) and then observed stimulation-induced RPS3 nuclear migration by confocal microscopy. Both TNF and PMA+I triggered RPS3 nuclear translocation in Jurkat cells transfected with a scrambled nonspecific (NS) siRNA (Fig. 2a)6. RPS3 nuclear translocation was only slightly, if at all, impaired by IKKalpha-silencing. Conversely, knockdown of IKKbeta attenuated 60-70% of RPS3 nuclear accumulation following stimulation (Fig. 2a). Immunoblotting of nuclear fractions confirmed that full expression of IKKbeta, but not IKKalpha, was necessary for activation-induced RPS3 nuclear translocation (Fig. 2b). Control immunoblots revealed that p65 nuclear translocation was blocked under the same conditions (Fig. 2b).
We next examined the nuclear translocation of RPS3 in cells ectopically expressing either kinase-dead (SSAA) or constitutively-active (SSEE) mutant IKKbeta proteins. As expected, the SSEE, but not SSAA, mutant of IKKbeta induced NF-kappaB-dependent luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 2c, left). Whereas RPS3 remained cytosolic in IKKbeta (SSAA)-expressing cells (Fig. 2c, right), a substantial proportion of RPS3 translocated to the nucleus in cells expressing IKKbeta (SSEE) (Fig. 2c, right). The percentage of cells containing detectable nuclear RPS3 increased 5-fold in IKKbeta (SSEE)-expressing cells, but not in IKKbeta (SSAA)-expressing ones (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus, IKKbeta activity is necessary and sufficient for RPS3 nuclear translocation in response to NF-kappaB activating stimuli.
