Tat counteracts the I==kappa==B-==alpha== inhibition of p65 by competing the repressor binding
We further investigated the physical interaction of Tat with I==kappa==B-==alpha== using in vitro translated proteins in coimmunoprecipitation assays. For mapping the interaction domains, we used the following Tat mutants: Tat T,N(23,24)A, Tat C(22,25,27)A, Tat K(50,51)A and Tat R(49-57)A (Figure 3A). I==kappa==B-==alpha== coimmunoprecipitated with all Tat proteins, except Tat R(49-57)A (Figure 3B). These results indicated that the arginine-rich domain of Tat was involved in the binding to I==kappa==B-==alpha==, which was consistent with previous observations (50,51). Moreover, Tat associating with I==kappa==B-==alpha== competed the binding of I==kappa==B-==alpha== to p65 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C, lanes 3-5), while Tat R(49-57)A, which lacked the binding site for I==kappa==B-==alpha==, did not associate with I==kappa==B-==alpha== and did not compete the binding of I==kappa==B-==alpha== to p65 (Figure 3C, lanes 6-8).
Next, we evaluated whether Tat counteracted the I==kappa==B-==alpha==-mediated inhibition of p65 binding to DNA by incubating in vitro translated p65 and I==kappa==B-==alpha== proteins with the NF-==kappa==B probe in presence or absence of Tat followed by EMSA. The p65 DNA binding activity was inhibited by I==kappa==B-==alpha== and restored in a dose-dependent manner by wild-type Tat, and not by Tat R(49-57) (Figure 3D). Further, we analysed the Tat effect on the I==kappa==B-==alpha== repression of p65 transcriptional activity by transfecting p50-/-p65-/-MEFs with the NF-==kappa==B-Luc reporter together with expression vectors of p65 and I==kappa==B-==alpha==, in presence or absence of Tat. I==kappa==B-==alpha== inhibited the p65-dependent expression of the luciferase gene, which was restored in a dose-dependent manner by wild-type Tat, and not by Tat R(49-57)A (Figure 3E). Altogether these results indicated that Tat counteracts the I==kappa==B-==alpha== repression of the p65 DNA-binding and transcriptional activity by associating with I==kappa==B-==alpha== and competing the repressor binding to p65.
