Tat counteracts the IkappaB-alpha inhibition of p65 by competing the repressor binding
We further investigated the physical interaction of Tat with IkappaB-alpha using in vitro translated proteins in coimmunoprecipitation assays. For mapping the interaction domains, we used the following Tat mutants: Tat T,N(23,24)A, Tat C(22,25,27)A, Tat K(50,51)A and Tat R(49-57)A (Figure 3A). IkappaB-alpha coimmunoprecipitated with all Tat proteins, except Tat R(49-57)A (Figure 3B). These results indicated that the arginine-rich domain of Tat was involved in the binding to IkappaB-alpha, which was consistent with previous observations (50,51). Moreover, Tat associating with IkappaB-alpha competed the binding of IkappaB-alpha to p65 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C, lanes 3-5), while Tat R(49-57)A, which lacked the binding site for IkappaB-alpha, did not associate with IkappaB-alpha and did not compete the binding of IkappaB-alpha to p65 (Figure 3C, lanes 6-8).
Next, we evaluated whether Tat counteracted the IkappaB-alpha-mediated inhibition of p65 binding to DNA by incubating in vitro translated p65 and IkappaB-alpha proteins with the NF-kappaB probe in presence or absence of Tat followed by EMSA. The p65 DNA binding activity was inhibited by IkappaB-alpha and restored in a dose-dependent manner by wild-type Tat, and not by Tat R(49-57) (Figure 3D). Further, we analysed the Tat effect on the IkappaB-alpha repression of p65 transcriptional activity by transfecting p50-/-p65-/-MEFs with the NF-kappaB-Luc reporter together with expression vectors of p65 and IkappaB-alpha, in presence or absence of Tat. IkappaB-alpha inhibited the p65-dependent expression of the luciferase gene, which was restored in a dose-dependent manner by wild-type Tat, and not by Tat R(49-57)A (Figure 3E). Altogether these results indicated that Tat counteracts the IkappaB-alpha repression of the p65 DNA-binding and transcriptional activity by associating with IkappaB-alpha and competing the repressor binding to p65.
