Cell Culture
The murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). RAW 264.7 cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 5% FBS and antibiotic-antimycotic (1000 U/ml penicillin, 1000 microg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B) at 37degreesC. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) cell line lacking specific NFkappaB signaling subunits NF-kappaB p65 (p65-/- cell line) [50] were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotic-antimycotic solution.
