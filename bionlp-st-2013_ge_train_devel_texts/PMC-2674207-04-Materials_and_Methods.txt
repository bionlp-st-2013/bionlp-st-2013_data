Cell Culture and PBMC Isolation
A human T cell line (HuT-78) was purchased from ECACC European Collection of Cell Culture (Wiltshire, UK) were cultured as previously described [12]. PBMCs were isolated by density centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque (density, 1.077 g/ml; Amersham Biosciences, Amersham, UK) as previously described [34]. Cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 (1 microg/ml each) for 1 h at 37degreesC to stimulate Th2 cytokine release in the presence or absence of FP (10-12 to 10-8M). Cytospins were prepared and GATA-3 localization determined by confocal microscopy as previously described [12].
