M-CSF-dependent PKC Regulates NF-==kappa==B-targeted Genes
NF-==kappa==B induces a number of downstream genes, including the I==kappa==B family. Among the I==kappa==B molecules, I==kappa==B==alpha== is highly induced by NF-==kappa==B activation [40]. Having shown that PKC regulated NF-==kappa==B activity in M-CSF-stimulated MDMs, we next determined whether inhibition of PKC activity decreased expression of NF-==kappa==B-regulated genes. We treated both MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells with the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes and then stimulated with M-CSF. I==kappa==B==alpha== gene was measured by qRT-PCR. As shown in Figures 6A and 6B, M-CSF enhanced I==kappa==B==alpha== gene expression and PKC inhibition by Ro-31-8220 decreased I==kappa==B==alpha== gene expression in both MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells (p==lt==0.01), demonstrating that PKC affected NF-==kappa==B-regulated gene expression in macrophages.
To further define the role of PKC in mediating human MDM survival in response to M-CSF, we examined the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-xL, which is also regulated by NF-==kappa==B. As shown in Figure 6C, Ro-31-8220 reduced M-CSF-stimulated BCL-xL expression compared to cells treated with M-CSF and the vehicle control DMSO (p==lt==0.05).
