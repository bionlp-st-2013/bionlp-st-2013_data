Degraded CGN induced monocytes aggregation in vitro.
Monocytes were incubated in the absence (A) or the presence of 1 mg/ml 10 kDa dCGN (B), 1 mg/ml 40 kDa dCGN (C), or 1 mg/ml 40 kDa dCGN plus 2.5 microg/ml anti-ICAM-1 antibody (D). Cells were observed by phase contrast inverse microscopy at 150X magnification. Inserts in A and B show a close up of cells at 300X magnification. E: Number of monocyte aggregates in 24 wells plate of PBM cell cultured with nothing (control), with 10 kDa degraded CGN (C10), or with 40 kDa degraded CGN (C40). Some cultures had also 2.5 microg/ml anti-ICAM-1 antibody. Data are mean +/- SEM.
