Western Blot Analysis
THP-1 cells were stimulated for various lengths of time with 0.1 mg/ml C10 or C40, or 10 ==micro==g/ml LPS. Cells were then pelleted, washed and homogenised in lysis buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.6% NP-40, and 0.5 mM PMSF) on ice. Homogenates were sonicated, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm to remove cellular debris, and supernatant collected. Protein concentration was determined using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins in samples (15 ==micro==g total proteins) were resolved in a denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. I-==kappa==B==alpha== protein was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat polyclonal antibody against rabbit Ig (Caltag Laboratories). Finally, I==kappa==B bands were revealed using the ECL==trade== detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Les Ullis, France) according to the manufacturers' instruction. Antibody to ==alpha==-Tubulin (Santa Cruz) was use as loading control.
For nuclear NF-==kappa==B, THP-1 cells were stimulated with 1 mg/ml C10 or C40 for 30 minutes at 37==degrees==C. Cells were then pelleted and nuclei separated as described [31]. Nuclei were washed and homogenized directly in loading (Laemli) buffer and heated for 5 minutes at 100==degrees==C. Proteins in samples were resolved in a denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (1% BSA, in PBS) for two hours at room temperature. Membranes were subsequently probed with the corresponding antibody in blocking buffer, overnight. Rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-NF-==kappa==B p50 subunit (# sc-114) or anti-NF-==kappa==B p65 subunit (# sc-109) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were used. Membranes were washed six times in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20, 5 minutes each time, and incubated with a 1/3000 dilution of HRP-conjugated F(ab')2 goat anti-rabbit IgG in 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing six more times in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20, antibody-reactive proteins were detected using a chemiluminescence substrate (SuperSignal; Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To confirm that equivalent amounts of protein were loaded in each line, membranes were also Western blotted for ERK as described [32].
