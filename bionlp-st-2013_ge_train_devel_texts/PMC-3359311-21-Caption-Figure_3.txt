Airway cells do not strongly upregulate caspase-1 activity in response to inflammasome stimuli.
S9 and IB3-1 cells were examined for caspase-1 activation following inflammasome stimulation with P. aeruginosa (MOI = 10) and ATP (5 mM). Cells were primed with LPS for 5 hours where appropriate. A representative histogram of % caspase-1-active cells is shown in (A) and the averaged values are shown in (B) (n = 3 separate experiments). (C) IB3-1 cells (5x104 cells/well) were pre-treated for 1 hour with increasing concentrations of z-YVAD-fmk (10-30 microM) prior to stimulation with P. aeruginosa (MOI = 50). Cell culture supernatants were collected after 6 hours and assayed for IL-6 by ELISA (n = 3).
