Airway epithelial cells do not significantly contribute to IL-1beta production in response to inflammasome stimuli.
Control cell lines ((A) S9, (C) NuLi-1) and their corresponding CF cell lines ((B) IB3-1, and (D) CuFi-1) cells were stimulated with P. aeruginosa (MOI = 10), ATP (5 mM), or IL-1beta (10 ng/ml), for the indicated times (n = 3 individual experiments). Cells were primed with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 hours where appropriate. Cell culture supernatants were assayed for IL-1beta and IL-8 production by ELISA. Insert shows IL-8 secretion in response to stimulation with IL-1beta (10 ng/ml).
