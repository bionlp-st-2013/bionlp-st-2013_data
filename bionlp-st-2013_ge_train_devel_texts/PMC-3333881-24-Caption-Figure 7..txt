Model of MIP-1==alpha== transcriptional activation by HIV-1 Tat. (A) In absence of Tat, I==kappa==B-==alpha== occupies the NF-==kappa==B enhancer of the MIP-1==alpha== promoter and likely interacts with transcriptional repressors, such as HDACs (65), to inhibit gene transcription. (B) Tat activates the MIP-1==alpha== expression by removing the I==kappa==B-==alpha== repressor from the NF-==kappa==B enhancer, and by increasing the binding of p65 NF-==kappa==B complex to the NF-==kappa==B enhancer.
