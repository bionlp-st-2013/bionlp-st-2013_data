The Inhibitory Effect of Corticosteroids on GATA-3 Nuclear Localization in Primary T Lymphocytes Ex Vivo and In Vivo
Treatment with FP ex vivo demonstrated a concentration-dependent decrease in the direct interaction between phospho-GATA-3 and importin-alpha in PBMCs from patients with asthma (Figure 6A and 6B), which was significantly inhibited at 10-12 M FP (p<0.001, ANOVA and Newman-Keuls test) and completely attenuated by 10-8 M FP (p<0.001, ANOVA and Newman-Keuls test).
Our previous T cell line studies indicated that 10-12 M FP suppresses IL-4 and -5 gene expression and attenuated the interaction of GATA-3 with importin-alpha (see Figures 1D and 2). This concentration is close to peak plasma levels obtained from asthmatic patients treated with inhaled FP (500 microg) [27]. Inhaled FP (500 microg) treatment of seven steroid-naive asthma patients significantly reduced GATA-3-importin-alpha interaction in vivo in a time-dependent manner. This produced a >90% decrease in GATA-3-importin-alpha association at 2 h (median [95% CI], 13,494 [6,828-17,829] versus 879 [597-1,165]; p<0.05 Friedman's analysis). However, this did not reach significance using Wilcoxon's post-test analysis (W = 6.00) probably due to low numbers of participants. Similar results were observed when GATA-3-importin-alpha association was measured (Figure 6C and 6D). The lower dose of FP (100 microg) was not effective. The attenuated interaction of GATA-3 did not result from the defective recycling of importin-alpha, as a significant decrease in the abundance of importin-alpha in the cytoplasmic pool was not detected (Figure 6E).
We further examined whether inhaled FP could affect cellular localization of GATA-3 in peripheral blood T cells. Treatment with inhaled FP (500 microg) for 2 h significantly increased GR nuclear translocation (Figure 7A) and concomitantly decreased the number of nuclear GATA-3 immunoreactive peripheral blood T cells (37%+/-4.2% versus 58.2%+/-4.95%, p = 0.016, W = 28.0, Wilcoxon's rank test) compared with placebo as measured by immunocytochemistry (Figure 7A and 7B). This was confirmed by Western blotting, which also indicated that this effect was both time- and dose-dependent (Figure 7C and 7D). Thus, inhaled FP (500 microg) induced significant loss in nuclear GATA-3 at 2 h (median [95% CI], 0.40 [0.27-0.53] versus 0.14 [0.11-0.19], p<0.05, W = 21.00, Wilcoxon's rank test) (Figure 7C) and cytoplasmic GATA-3 levels were enhanced by inhaled FP in a dose-dependent manner (median [95% CI], 0.0032 [0.0026-0.0039] versus 0.658 [0.592-0.720], p<0.05, W = -21.00, Wilcoxon's rank test) (Figure 7D). In addition, FP (500 microg) inhibited p38 MAPK phosphorylation in primary T cells in vivo at 2 h in samples from two patients (Figure 7E).
Taken together, our data suggest that inhaled FP reduces nuclear localization of GATA-3 in vivo by acutely inhibiting phospho-GATA-3-importin association. This effect may be direct, through competition for importin-alpha or associated molecules, or secondary to an effect on p38 MAPK-mediated GATA-3 phosphorylation via rapid induction of MKP-1. The combination of these two interacting effects can result in complete suppression of GATA-3 nuclear import and thus Th2 cytokine gene expression.
