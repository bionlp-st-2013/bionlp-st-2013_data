Effect of PTX on TNF-alpha production in the presence of PKA inhibition
The role of PKA in PTX-induced downregulation of TNF-alpha production in LPS-stimulated mononuclear cells was assessed by treating mononuclear cells with H89, a PKA inhibitor, prior to LPS and PTX exposure. The addition PTX to LPS-stimulated cells resulted in a reduction in TNF-alpha, similar to that observed in our previous experiments (529 pg/mL +/- 112 vs. 37 pg/mL +/- 10; P < 0.01). Pre-incubation of cells with H89 prior to LPS and PTX exposure did not result in any significant modulation of TNF-alpha production when compared to that demonstrated with PTX alone (P = 0.2; Figure 5). These results suggest that downregulation of TNF-alpha production by PTX in LPS-stimulated mononuclear cells is, at least in part, PKA-independent.
