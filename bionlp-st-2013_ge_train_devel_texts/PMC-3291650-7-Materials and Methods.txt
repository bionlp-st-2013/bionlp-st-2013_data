Mice
A20fl/fl mice were generated as previously described [56]. A20fl/fl mice were crossed with LysM-Cre mice [84] (provided by I. Forster, Institute of Genetics, University of Cologne, Germany) to generate A20fl/fl LysMCre transgenes and are described in detail elsewhere [48]. Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages at the VIB Department of Molecular Biomedical Research in specific pathogen-free animal facilities. Influenza infections were performed on age- (between 7 and 9 weeks old) and sex-matched littermates. A20fl/fl LysM-Cre animals were backcrossed three times to the C57Bl/6 background. A20fl/fl mice expressing or lacking the LysM-Cre transgene were termed A20myel-KO and wild type (A20myel-WT) respectively.
