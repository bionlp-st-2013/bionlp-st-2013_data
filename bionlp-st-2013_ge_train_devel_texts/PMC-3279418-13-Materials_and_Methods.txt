BMDC-T cell in vitro interaction
WT and cpdm BMDC (5x104) were stimulated with medium, 1 microg/mL LPS, 25 microg/mL and 5 microg/mL Pam3CYS. 24 hours later, cells were collected and washed with PBS. Allogeneic naive CD4+ T cells were isolated from spleens of BALB/c mice by negative selection kit (Invitrogen) and were then added at 2.5x105 and co-cultured with activated BMDC. After 5 days, supernatant was collected and the secretion of IFNgamma, IL4, IL2, and IL17A measured by ELISA. Negative controls are 1) stimulated BMDC without co-culture with allogeneic CD4+ T cells; 2) allogeneic CD4+ T cells without co-culture with stimulated BMDC. Both negative controls show no production of aforementioned cytokines.
