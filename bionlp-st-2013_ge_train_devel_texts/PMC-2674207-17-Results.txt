Ligand-Activated GR Competes with GATA-3 for Importin-alpha
We confirmed and extended previous data [20] to show that ligand-activated GR as well as GATA-3 uses importin-alpha for its nuclear import (Figure 2A and 2B). This interaction between GR and importin-alpha was significant at concentrations as low as 10-12 M and was maximal with 10-8 M FP. Subsequent GR nuclear translocation was rapid and sustained at significant levels for at least 14 h (Figure 2B). Using IP-Western blotting we showed that FP at 10-12-10-8 M decreased the association between GATA-3 and importin-alpha induced by anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2C). In addition, using GFP-labelled GATA-3 and confocal microscopy we demonstrated that GATA-3 nuclear import following anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation for 30 min was attenuated by pretreatment with FP (10-8 M) (Figure 2D).
