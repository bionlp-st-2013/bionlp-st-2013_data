RT-PCR Analysis
Total RNA from monocytes was isolated using TRIzol Reagent==trade== (Invitrogen). cDNA was generated on 1 ==micro==g of total RNA in a reaction volume of 20 ==micro==l, using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was done in the linear range of amplification (determined for each primer pair-cDNA combination). Standard PCR reactions were performed with 1 ==micro==l of the cDNA solution, 50 ==micro==M of each primer solution, 10 mM of each dNTP, 25 mM MgCl2, 10X Goldstar DNA polymerase reaction buffer, and 0.5 units of Goldstar DNA polymerase (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). First PCR cycle consisted of 1 min at 92==degrees==C, 1 min at 58==degrees==C and 1 min at 72==degrees==C; then each PCR cycle consisted of 40 sec at 92==degrees==C, 40 sec at 58==degrees==C and 50 sec at 72==degrees==C. cDNA for ==beta==-actin was amplified for 28 cycles using the oligos: sense 5'-GGCATCGTGATGGACTCCG-3' and antisense 5'GCTGGAAGGTGGACAGCGA-3'. cDNA for TNF-==alpha== was amplified for 35 cycles using the oligos: sense 5'-AAGCCTGTAGCCCATGTTGT-3' and antisense 5'-CAGATAGATGGGCTCATACC-3'. cDNA for ICAM-1 was amplified for 35 cycles using the oligos sense 5'-GTAGCAGCCGCAGTCATAATGG-3' and antisense 5'-A TGCTGTTGTATCTGACTGAGG-3'.
