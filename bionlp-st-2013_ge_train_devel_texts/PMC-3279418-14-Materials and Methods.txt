RNA expression by BMDC
BMDC were cultured at 106 cells/mL in 10 mL of RPMI-1640 complete medium in the presence or absence of 100 ng/mL LPS or 25 ==micro==g/mL poly I:C. After 1 and 2 hours, RNA was isolated with TRI-reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression of Il6, Il12p40, Gmcsf, and Sharpin mRNA was determined by qRT-PCR. Primers and probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Reverse transcription was performed at 42==degrees==C for 60 minutes with the final denaturation step at 90==degrees==C for 5 minutes in 30 ==micro==l containing 0.5 ==micro==g of total RNA. dNTPs, oligo(dT)15 primer, recombinant RNasin Ribonuclease Inhibitor, and M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (all from Promega, Madison, WI) were used according to the manufacturer's instruction. Reverse transcription was done in a PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Watertown, MA). qRT-PCR was performed in ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System with TaqMan(R) Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for mouse Actb, IL6, IL12p40, Ifn==beta==, Gmcsf, and Sharpin according to the manufacturer's protocol. The endogenous standard for normalization of the target gene was ==beta==-actin. Relative gene expression was calculated using the 2-==Delta====Delta==Ct method [56].
