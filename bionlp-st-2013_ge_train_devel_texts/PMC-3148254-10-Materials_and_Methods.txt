Retroviral transduction
A retroviral vector (pMIP) was used for the stable transduction of cells with HOIP and IKKgamma cDNA constructs. pMIP was constructed by replacing the IRES and GFP encoding sequences in pMIG [31] with the IRES and puromycin resistance gene from pIRESpuro2 (Clontech). FLAG-tagged mouse HOIP cDNA was inserted into the multiple cloning site of pMIP. A pMIP construct encoding mouse IKKgamma with an amino terminal birch profilin peptide (BP)-tag was also prepared. Retroviral particles were generated by transient transfection of 293T cells with pMIP, pMIP-HOIP, or pMIP-IKKgamma and the packaging vector pCL-Eco [32]. Two days after transfection, culture supernatants were harvested and filtered. A20.2J or HOIP-deficient cells were added to 24-well plates (2.5x105 cells/well) with 1 ml virus-containing supernatant and 8 microg/ml polybrene. Plates were centrifuged at 500 x g for 2 hrs at room temperature. Cells were cultured in B cell culture medium for 48 hrs, after which the transduced cells were selected in 3 microg/ml puromycin.
