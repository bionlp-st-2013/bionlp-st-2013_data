In vitro suppression assays.
Mouse Foxp3+ CD4+ CD8- T cells were FACS purified based on GFP expressed from a Foxp3-IRES-GFP knock-in allele (Foxp3GFP). Naive (CD62Lhi44lo25-) CD4+ T cells (effectors) were FACS-purified from Cd45.1 mice, then loaded with 5 microM CFSE (Invitrogen). Total splenocytes from C57BL/6 mice inactivated with 50 microg/ml mitomycin C (Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min were used as APCs. A total of 4 x 105 CD4+ cells (CFSE-loaded CD25- plus Foxp3-GFP+) was mixed with 105 APCs + 1 microg/ml anti-CD3 mAb per well of a 96 well round bottom plate. Proliferation of the effector cells was analyzed by CFSE dilution. Apoptosis of the cells was investigated by annexin V staining and flow cytometry. Positive and negative control gates were made according to T cells cultured only in the presence of IL-2 without anti-CD3/28 stimulation.
Human naive CD4+ T cells were isolated by negative selection by MACS from PBMCs and either transfected with a scrambled siRNA or with a combination of RUNX1 and RUNX3 siRNA. Cells were then cultured under iT reg cell differentiating conditions and mixed with 2 x 105 autologous irradiated PBMCs that were used as APCs and autologous CFSE-labeled CD4+ T cells. T reg cell to responder cell ratio was 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5. To check the proliferation of the CD4+ T cells without suppression, no T reg cells were added in a control group. Cells were stimulated with 2.5 microg/ml anti-CD3 mAb, cultured in a 96-well plate and the proliferation of the effector cells was determined by analyzing the CFSE dilution by flow cytometry after 5 d of culture. Gating on the CD4+CFSE+ T cells enabled the exclusion of APCs and T reg cells.
