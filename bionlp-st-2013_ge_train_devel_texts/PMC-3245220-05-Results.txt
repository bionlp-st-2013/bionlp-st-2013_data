M-CSF-Induces PKC==alpha== Kinase Activity
Since our data suggested that conventional PKCs were involved in activating NF-==kappa==B in response to M-CSF in primary human macrophages, we next investigated whether the conventional PKC, PKC==alpha== was a downstream target of M-CSF in human MDMs. PKC==alpha== was immunoprecipitated from human MDMs at the indicated time points (Figure 4), and then a PKC kinase assay was performed using a fluorescein-tagged peptide as a substrate. As shown in Figure 4 (upper panel), the peptide substrate was maximally phosphorylated within 10 minutes of stimulation (1.8-fold over resting cells, lower panel), and then returned to basal levels by 15 minutes. This effect was not seen in M-CSF-stimulated monocytes when isogenic antibodies (IgG) were used for immunoprecipitation. Western blots of identical samples using an antibody recognizing PKC==alpha== demonstrated that equal amounts of PKC==alpha== were assayed (Figure 4, middle panel).
