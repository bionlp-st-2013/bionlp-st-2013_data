Th2 Cells Do Not Express FOXP3
(A) Intracellular FACS analysis of FOXP3 expression in Th1, Th2, or iTreg-differentiated cells (two rounds, phenotype see Figure S1), rested or activated, with or without TGF-beta. FOXP3 expression was measured after 5 d in culture. The dot blots are representative of three independent experiments.
(B) Shows the same experimental setup, but naturally occurring Th2 cells were analyzed. Data are representative of three independent experiments.
