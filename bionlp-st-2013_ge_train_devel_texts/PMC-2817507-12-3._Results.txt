3.4. Activation of TLR4-Mediated NF-Kappa-B Signaling
Activation of TLR4 induces the phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa-B (I==kappa==B), which dissociates I==kappa==B with NF-kappa-B (NF==kappa==B). Then, NF==kappa==B translocates into the nucleus and activates and regulates the transcription of genes related to inflammatory responses. To detectd the activation of TLR4-mediated NF==kappa==B signaling, the phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa-B (p-I==kappa==B) and activity of NF==kappa==B were measured by methods of Western Blots and EMSA. Results showed that the p-I==kappa==B increased at 6 hours after ICH (P < .05), peaked on 3 days after ICH, and maintained a high level on 7 days after ICH (P < .05, Figure 5). As expected, the activity of NF==kappa==B was also increased in the same manner as that of the p-I==kappa==B (Figure 4).
