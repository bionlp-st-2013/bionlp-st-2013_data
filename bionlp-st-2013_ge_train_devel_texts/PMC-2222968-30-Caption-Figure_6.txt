IL-4 Inhibits TGF-beta-Mediated iTreg Commitment
CFSE-labeled CD4+CD45RA+ cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28, TGF-beta, and IL-4, as indicated. After 5 d, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (A) and results of six independent experiments are shown in the bar graph below (B). Statistical significance (one-way Anova, Newman-Keuls) is indicated by asterisks (**p <= 0.01, ***p <= 0.001). (C) Kinetic analysis of intracellular GATA3 and FOXP3 staining is shown in panel C following exposure of CD4+CD45RA+ T cells to anti-CD3/28, IL-4 and TGF-beta. Data are representative of three independent experiments.
