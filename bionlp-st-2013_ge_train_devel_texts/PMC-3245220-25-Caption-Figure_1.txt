M-CSF induces NF-kappaB transcriptional activity in macrophages.
(A) Nuclei were extracted from human MDMs treated without or with M-CSF for 15 or 30 minutes. NF-kappaB DNA binding activity was analyzed by EMSA Shown is a representative blot from three independent experiments. NS: non-stimulated. (B) Human MDMs transiently transfected with pTAL-SEAP or pNF-kappaB-SEAP constructs were treated with M-CSF in X-vivo medium and incubated for 6 hours before the collection of medium. NF-kappaB activity was analyzed by measuring the amount of SEAP secreted into the medium and data are expressed as fold increase of SEAP activity over that in pTAL-SEAP transfected resting cells. (C) RAW 264.7 cells were transiently transfected with pTAL-SEAP or pNF-kappaB-SEAP construct. Cells were serum starved for 4 hours prior to 2 hours stimulation with mouse recombinant M-CSF (100 ng/ml). Culture media was collected to measure SEAP production. Data are expressed mean +/- S.E.M, for three independent experiments.
