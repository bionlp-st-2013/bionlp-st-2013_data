Transient Transfection of Primary Human Monocytes
Monocytes were transfected using the human monocyte Amaxa nucleofector kit (Lonza Walkersville Inc, Walkersville, MD) as previously described [51]. Briefly, monocytes were resuspended in Amaxa Nucleofactor solution at a density of 20x106 cells/ml, and 2 microg of total plasmid DNA 100 nM of PKCalpha siRNA or control siRNA was added and transfected using program Amaxa Y-01. For co-transfection studies, PKCalpha or NF-kappaB p65 constructs were mixed at a ratio of 5:1 with the reporter plasmid. Immediately after transfection, cells were washed with 1 ml of RPMI medium containing 2 mM glutamine and 10% FBS or serum free LGM medium (Lonza Walkersville Inc.) then plated at 4x105 cells/well in 24-well plates. The original medium was replaced by serum free LGM medium without or with M-CSF (100 ng/ml) one hour later. The next day, cell-free supernatants were collected for the SEAP analysis. Cells were stained with Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI). For the inhibition studies, cells were pre-incubated with inhibitor for 30 minutes in X-vivo medium prior to the addition of M-CSF.
