Disruption of NF-==kappa==B or NFAT5 sites in the LTR inhibits MTb-induced HIV-1 replication in MDM.
MDM from four normal donors were infected with 1000 TCID50 of HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-WT or the mutants HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-==kappa==B I-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-==kappa==B II-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-==kappa==B I+II-Mut, or HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-N5-Mut, and were either (A) left infected with virus alone or (B) co-infected with MTb CDC1551 (1:1 MDM:bacilli). Viral p24 levels in the culture supernatants were measured at days 4, 7 and 12 post-infection. Presentation of viral p24 levels at day 12 in cultures infected with (C) HIV-1 alone or (D) co-infected with MTb are shown as histograms. (*, p==lt==0.05; **, p==lt==0.01, as compared to HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-WT).
