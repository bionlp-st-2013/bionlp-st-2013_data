LMP1 Activates Akt Signaling and Deregulates the Rb Cell Cycle Pathway
(A and B) Immunoblot analysis of purified B cells (CD19+) from the spleens of WT and LMP1 transgenic mice for Akt signaling, probing for (A) activated pAkt and downstream targets, including inactivated pGSK3alpha/beta, and (B) activated p-mTOR, and total levels of FoxO1. Arrows indicate the positions of alpha and beta isoforms of GSK3. The white line indicates that intervening lanes have been spliced out.
(C) Immunoblot analysis for cell cycle proteins regulating the Rb pathway, probing for activated pRb, and total levels of Cdk2 and the Cdk inhibitor p27. Actin was used as a loading control.
