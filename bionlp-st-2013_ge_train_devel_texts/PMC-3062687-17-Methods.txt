RNAi and Transfection
The siRNA (sense-strand sequence) IKKalpha, 5'-AUGACAGAGAAUGAUCAUGUUCUGC -3'; IKKbeta, 5'-GCAGCAAGGAGAACAGAGGUUAAUA -3'; IkappaBalpha, 5'-GAGCUCCGAGACUUUCGAGGAAAUA -3'; RPS3-3' UTR, 5'-GGAUGUUGCUCUCUAAAGACC -3' (Invitrogen). Transient transfection of siRNA and DNA constructs into Jurkat cells and 293T cells was described previously6.
