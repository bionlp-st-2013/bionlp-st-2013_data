Inhibition of M-CSF-induced PKC reduces NF-kappaB-regulated genes in both MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells.
MDMs (A and C) and RAW 264.7 (B) cells were pretreated with Ro-31-8220 or solvent control DMSO for 30 minutes prior to M-CSF stimulation for the indicated times. Total RNA was isolated and converted to cDNA. Real-time RT PCR was performed using primers for IkappaBalpha, BCL-xl or GAPDH. Data are expressed as relative fold increase of IkappaBalpha or BCL-xl gene expression upon treatment over non-stimulated cells. Data represent the mean +/- S.E.M for three independent experiments.
