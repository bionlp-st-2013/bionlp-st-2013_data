M-CSF-Dependent Activation of PKC Does Not Regulate the Classical NF-==kappa==B p65 Activation Pathway
Canonical activation of NF-==kappa==B occurs via phosphorylation and degradation of I==kappa==B==alpha== leading to the release and nuclear translocation of the NF-==kappa==B p50/p65 heterodimer to transactivate target genes [37], [39]. Since conventional PKC activity was important in regulating M-CSF-induced NF-==kappa==B activation, we next investigated whether I==kappa==B==alpha== degradation was regulated by PKC. Cells were treated with cyclohexamide (CHX) to inhibit protein synthesis of I==kappa==B==alpha==, and its degradation was followed. As shown in Figure 5A, PKC inhibition with Ro-31-8220 did not alter M-CSF-induced I==kappa==B==alpha== degradation, suggesting that M-CSF-induced PKC activity augmented NF-==kappa==B transcriptional activity by an alternative pathway, like post-translational modification of NF-==kappa==B p65.
