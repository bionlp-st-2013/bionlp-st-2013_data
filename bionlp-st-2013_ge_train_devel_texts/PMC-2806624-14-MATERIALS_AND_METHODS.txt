Transfections and reporter gene assays.
T cells were rested in serum-free AIM-V medium overnight. 3.5 microg of the FOXP3 promoter luciferase reporter vector or a combination together with the RUNX1, RUNX3 pEGFPN1 vector, and 0.5 microg phRL-TK were added to 3 x 106 CD4+ T cells resuspended in 100 microl of Nucleofector solution (Lonza) and electroporated using the program U-15. After a 24-h culture in serum-free conditions and stimuli as indicated in the figures, luciferase activity was measured by the dual luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PMA/ionomycin was used to stimulate the cells, because the transfection was only transient and the luciferase assay required a strong and fast stimulation of the cells. To evaluate the effect of overexpression of RUNX1 or RUNX3 on FOXP3 protein levels, CD4+ T cells were preactivated with 2 microg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich) in serum-free AIM-V medium in the presence of 1 nmol/liter IL-2 (Roche) for 12 h, and then transfected with the vector pEGFPN1 containing the RUNX1 or RUNX3 fragment using the Nucleofector system (Amaxa Biosystems) and the program T-23. FOXP3 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry after 48 h of culture in AIM-V medium containing 1 nmol/liter IL-2.
