M-CSF-Dependent Activation of PKC Does Not Regulate the Classical NF-kappaB p65 Activation Pathway
Canonical activation of NF-kappaB occurs via phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha leading to the release and nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB p50/p65 heterodimer to transactivate target genes [37], [39]. Since conventional PKC activity was important in regulating M-CSF-induced NF-kappaB activation, we next investigated whether IkappaBalpha degradation was regulated by PKC. Cells were treated with cyclohexamide (CHX) to inhibit protein synthesis of IkappaBalpha, and its degradation was followed. As shown in Figure 5A, PKC inhibition with Ro-31-8220 did not alter M-CSF-induced IkappaBalpha degradation, suggesting that M-CSF-induced PKC activity augmented NF-kappaB transcriptional activity by an alternative pathway, like post-translational modification of NF-kappaB p65.
