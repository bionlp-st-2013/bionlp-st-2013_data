Inhaled fluticasone propionate impairs GATA-3 nuclear localization in PBMCs.
(A) Representative immunocytochemistry of showing the effect of inhaled FP (500 microg) on GR and GATA-3 nuclear localisation. (B) Nuclear GATA-3 immunoreactivity in PBMCs from seven steroid-naive asthma patients 2 h following inhaled FP treatment (100 or 500 microg via spacer). The median and interquartile ranges for each treatment are presented as a box-and-whiskers plot (n = 7); * p<0.05 Wilcoxon's rank test compared with placebo. (C) Immunoblotting analyses of PBMCs demonstrated a time-dependent decrease in nuclear expression of GATA-3, and increased cytoplasmic GATA-3 expression after inhalation of FP. (D) Immunoblotting analyses of PBMCs demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in nuclear expression of GATA-3, and increased cytoplasmic GATA-3 expression 2 h after inhalation of FP. Histone H1 and MEK-1 immunoblotting confirmed equivalent total protein loading for the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions respectively. Quantification of the densitometry data in (C) and (D) is shown as a box-and-whiskers plot of results from n = 6 participants for which data were available. *p<0.05 compared to control. (E) Western blot analyses of PBMCs demonstrated a time-dependent decrease in dual phosphorylation (threonine-180 and tyrosine-182) of p38 MAPK after inhalation of FP (500 microg). The results shown in (E) are representative of samples from two participants.
