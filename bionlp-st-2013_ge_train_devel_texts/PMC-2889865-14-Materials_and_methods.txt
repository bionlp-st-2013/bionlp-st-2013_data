RNA extraction
Jurkat T-cells were treated with NF-kappaB, JNK and PKC inhibitors for 2 h in 6-well plates followed by stimulation with 162 nM PMA for 24 h. At sampling the cells were pelleted followed by RNA extraction using 100 mul TRI-reagent (Sigma, USA). This was followed by addition of 100 mul chloroform/isoamylalcohol (24/1). The solutions were mixed by vortexing followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4degreesC. The upper phase was transferred to a new tube followed by addition of 100 mul iso-propanol and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. RNA was then pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4degreesC and washed with 70% ethanol. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 25 mul RNase free water and the yield and ratio (A260/A280) was determined using NanoVue (GE Healthcare, UK). The samples were stored at -80degreesC until further use.
