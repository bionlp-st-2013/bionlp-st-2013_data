CD80 upregulation and flow cytometry
Cells (5x104 in 2 ml) were cultured in 24-well plates for 3 days with 5 microg/ml anti-CD40 or an isotype control antibody. Cells were stained for flow cytometry with FITC-anti-CD80 or an appropriate control antibody as described [28]. Data acquired with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) were analyzed with WinMDI 2.8 (Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, CA).
