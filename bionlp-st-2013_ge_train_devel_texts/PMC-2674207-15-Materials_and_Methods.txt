Statistical Analysis
Data from three or more independent experiments are presented as the mean+/-standard error of the mean (SEM), except where stated and were compared using GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, http://www.graphpad.com). Results were analysed using one-way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls post test except for the data from the in vivo inhaled FP study, which was analysed by Friedman's test with subsequent Wilcoxson matched pair signed rank sum test. Data from this analysis are presented as a box-and-whiskers plot. Friedman's test was used as three matched measures were obtained using placebo, 100 microg, and 500 microg of inhaled FP, which had variable baseline levels. We did not assume a Gaussian distribution of the data due to the limited numbers of participants analysed (seven).The null hypothesis was rejected at p<0.05.
