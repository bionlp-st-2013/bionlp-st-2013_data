Disruption of CFTR activity does not increase IL-1beta production in PBMCs or macrophages.
PBMCs from CF patients (n = 15) and controls (n = 13) were treated with CFTRinh172 (10 microM) for 18 hours prior to stimulation with live PAO1 (MOI = 1). (A) IL-1beta and (B) IL-8 production was measured at 24 hours. (C) Monocytes from controls (n = 3) were differentiated into macrophages. Macrophages were treated with CFTRinh172, stimulated as per monocytes, and measured for IL-1beta production at 24 hours. THP-1 reporter cells were treated with CFTRinh172 24 hours prior to stimulation with PAO1 and measured for (D) IL-1beta secretion, (E) IL-8, and (F) NF-kappaB/AP-1 activity at 24 hours (n = 4).
