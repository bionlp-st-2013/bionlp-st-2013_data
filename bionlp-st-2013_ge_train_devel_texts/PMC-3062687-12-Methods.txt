Cells and Reagents
Jurkat E6.1, HEK293T and HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 and DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, and 100 U/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, respectively. IkappaBalpha (C-21, sc-371), p65 (C-20, sc-372), and phospho-threonine (H-2, sc-5267) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; beta-actin (AC-15, A5441), Flag (M2, F3165), HA (HA-7, H3663), importin-alpha (IM-75, I1784), and importin-beta (31H4, I2534) antibodies were from Sigma; PARP (C2-10, 556362), IKKalpha (B78-1, 556532), and IKKbeta (24, 611254) antibodies were from BD Pharmingen; CK2alpha (31, 611610) and Hsp90 (68, 610418) antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratories; phospho-IkappaBalpha (5A5, 9246S) and phospho-IKKalpha/beta (16A6, 2697S) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology; phospho-serine (AB1603) and phospho-tyrosine (4G10, 05-777) antibodies were from Millipore. The rabbit polyclonal RPS3 antiserum was as described previously6. The rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for S209 phosphorylated RPS3 was generated and affinity purified by Primm Biotech using the peptide NH2-CKPLPDHV(Sp)IVE-COOH.
