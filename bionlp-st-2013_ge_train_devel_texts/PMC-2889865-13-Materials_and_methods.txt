Western blot analysis
Following stimulation, Jurkat T-cells were centrifuged at 1000 x g for 8 min and lysed on ice for 2 h using sodium hydroxide with the addition of a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim). The cells were further centrifuged at 8000 x g, 4degreesC for 10 min and the supernatants were transferred to new tubes. Cytoplasmic proteins (~8 mug) were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) followed by western blotting using anti-IkappaBbeta, phospho-PKC (pan)(zeta Thr410)(190D10), anti-Bcl10 (Cell Signalling Technology, Boston) and beta-actin (Abcam, Cambridge). Detection was performed following incubation with ECL(TM) Anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase linked whole antibodies (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire) and developed using ECL(TM) Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare, UK).
