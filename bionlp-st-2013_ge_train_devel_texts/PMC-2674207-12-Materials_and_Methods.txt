Transfection
HuT-78 cells were transfected with either EP8 or GFP vector only DNA using solution R, programme V-001 at a ratio of 3x106 cells/4 microg DNA for 7-8 h in complete medium (10% bovine serum in RPMI1640+15 L-glutamine) according to the general Amaxa protocol for nucleofection. The medium was subsequently changed to 1% RPMI for 24 h before transfected cells were added to anti-CD3/CD28 treated wells and live cell videomicroscopy performed.
