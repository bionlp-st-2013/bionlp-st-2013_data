Effect of Native and Degraded CGN on THP-1 Proliferation and Cell Cycle
Preliminary observations by enumeration of THP-1 cells exposed to different concentrations of native and dCGN (10 and 40 kDa) during 2, 5 and 7 days, showed a decline in cell number (data not shown). This suggested that dCGN might cause an alteration in the cell cycle. Cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry showed an accumulation of THP-1 cells in G0/G1 phase, which was associated with a decrease number of cells in the S phase (Fig. 3A). The percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase was 45.2% for control cells, 62.6% for C10 dCGN (at 2 mg/ml), and 64.2% for C40 dCGN-treated cells (at 2 mg/ml) (Fig. 3B). The effect of dCGN on cell cycle was dose-dependent (Fig. 3B). Neither native nor dCGN had an effect on the number of cells in the G2/M phase (Fig. 3). This effect is not due to cytotoxicity of dCGN even at the highest concentration (i.e. 2 mg/ml) since cell viability was not affected (data not shown).
