Mice.
CbfbF/F CD4-cre and Foxp3GFP mice have previously been described (Bettelli et al., 2006; Naoe et al., 2007). Cd45.1 and Rag2-/- mice were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories and Taconic, respectively. For the in vivo Foxp3 conversion assay, naive CD4+ T cells from Cbfb CD4-cre or control mice (harboring a Foxp3-IRES-GFP allele) were adoptively transferred into Rag-deficient mice. 5 x 106 cells were used per transfer. 6 wk later, TCRbeta+CD4+ gated cells from the spleen, mesenteric lymph node (MLN), and lamina propria of the small intestine were analyzed for Foxp3-GFP expression. All analyses and experiments were performed on animals at 6-8 wk of age. Animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions at the animal facility of the Skirball Institute, and experiments were performed in accordance with approved protocols for the New York University Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee.
