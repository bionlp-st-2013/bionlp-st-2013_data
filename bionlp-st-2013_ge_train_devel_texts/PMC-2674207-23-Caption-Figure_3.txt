Fluticasone propionate-mediated inhibition of p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation and activation is associated with a marked down-regulation of GATA-3 serine phosphorylation.
(A) Western blot analysis shows that FP (10-8 M, 30 min) treatment reduced dual phosphorylation (threonine-180 and tyrosine-182) of p38 MAPK in anti-CD3/CD28-co-stimulated HuT-78 cells. (B) Time course of the effect of FP (10-8 M) on phosphorylation of activated transcription factor 2 (ATF-2), a measure of p38 MAPK activity. (C) FP-induced inhibition of p38 MAPK activity is associated with the decrease of anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulation-induced serine phosphorylation (P-Ser) of GATA-3. For (A-C), quantification of the densitometry data is also shown. Each bar represents mean+/-SEM of at least three independent experiments. ###p<0.001 compared to control, ***p<0.001 compared to alphaCD3/CD28-stimulated cells. (D) FP induced MKP-1 mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner. All results are representative of at least three independent experiments and where appropriate expressed as means+/-SEM, *p<0.05. (E) FP induces MKP-1 mRNA in a time-dependent manner. Results are representative of two independent experiments. All data except (E) were analysed by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test.
