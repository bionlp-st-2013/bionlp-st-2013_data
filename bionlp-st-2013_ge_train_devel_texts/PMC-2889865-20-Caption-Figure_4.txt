Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity by NAI. Jurkat T-cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing either NF-kappaB or AP-1 cis-acting elements. The cells were incubated with NF-kappaB activation inhibitor (NAI) for 1 h followed by stimulation with PMA (162 nM, A and C) or HK E. coli (5 x 107 CFU/ml, B and D) for 24 h. (A, B) NF-kappaB, but not (C, D) AP-1 was inhibited. Statistical significance from the positive control (PMA/HK E. coli) was determined using Student's t-test. (n = 4). Controls were set to 1.
