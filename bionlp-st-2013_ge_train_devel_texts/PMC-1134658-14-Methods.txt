Western-blot analysis
B cells from peripheral blood or cultured cell-lines were lysed in lysis buffer (glycerol 10%, beta-mercaptoethanol 5%, 0.0625 M Tris-HCL [pH 6.8], sodium dodecyl sulphate [SDS] 2.5%w/vol). Total protein (30-100 mug) from each sample was run on 10% or 12% SDS/polyacrylamide (SDS/PAGE) gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters (Protran; Schleicher &Schuell GmbH, Dassel, Germany). Blocking, washing and incubation of the filters with primary antibodies were done according to the manufacturer's protocols at room temperature (RT). After washing with TBS/0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T), the filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) coupled to relevant secondary antibodies (see above) for 60 minutes at RT. Enzyme activity was visualised by the enhanced chemiluminescence system, ECL+PLUS (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). Densitometric analysis was performed by scanning hyperfilms on a Personal Densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Quantification of Id1, Id2 and Id3 protein was calculated by normalizing the specific protein bands to beta-actin using Image Quant 5.5 software (Molecular Dynamics).
