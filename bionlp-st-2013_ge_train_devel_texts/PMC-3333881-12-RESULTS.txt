Tat enhances the NF-kappaB activity by hijacking IkappaB-alpha and inhibiting the post-activation turn off of NF-kappaB
We analysed the kinetic of NF-kappaB activation in single round HIV-1 infection by modulating the expression of Tat with RNA interference. Jurkat cells were transfected with siRNA Tat, siRNA control, or left untransfected, and 24 h later cells were infected with HXB2 Env-pseudotyped NL4-3.Luc.R-E- virions. By cytofluorimetric analysis, ~40% of cells was siRNA-transfected and HIV-1-infected at 12-h post-infection (Supplementary Figure S1). The expression of Tat was detected at 1-h post-infection and progressively increased up to 12 h in untransfected and siRNA control-transfected cells, while it was barely detected in siRNA Tat-transfected cells (Figure 1A). The LTR-dependent luciferase expression was also progressively induced at 1- to 12-h post-infection in untransfected and siRNA control-transfected cells, while it was barely observed in siRNA Tat-transfected cells, as expected for the Tat-dependent transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR (Figure 1A).
The progressive increase in NF-kappaB activity, as measured by p65-p50 binding to an NF-kappaB consensus oligonucleotide (Figure 1B) and nuclear p65 (Figure 1C, nucleus), was observed at 1- to 3-h post-infection in both Tat-positive (no siRNA or siRNA control) and Tat-negative (siRNA Tat) cells; however, at 12-h post-infection, the p65 DNA binding and nuclear p65 persisted elevated in presence of Tat (no siRNA and siRNA control), while they dropped in absence of Tat (siRNA Tat) (Figure 1B and C). IkappaB-alpha was degraded in the cytosol within 3-h post-infection and de novo synthesized at 6 h with full replenishment at 12-h post-infection in both Tat-positive and Tat-negative cells (Figure 1C, cytosol). Consistently, the IKK activity was induced at 1-h post-infection, and decreased at 3-h post-infection independently of the presence of Tat (Figure 1D). Similar kinetics of NF-kappaB activity, IKK activation and IkappaB-alpha degradation/re-synthesis were observed in single-round HIV-1 infection of PBMCs using a cocktail of Azidothymidine (AZT) and Lamivudine (3TC) as reverse transcriptase inhibitors (Supplementary Figure S2). These results indicated that in single-round HIV-1 infection the NF-kappaB activation initially correlated with the IKK activation and IkappaB-alpha degradation independently of the presence of Tat, and it was kept elevated in presence of Tat following the decay of the IKK activity and new synthesis of IkappaB-alpha.
Next, we tested the single action of Tat on the kinetic of NF-kappaB activity induced by PMA. To this end, HeLa cells were transfected with p3x-FLAG-Tat, or empty vector, stimulated with PMA for 5 min, and extensively washed to avoid the oscillatory kinetic of NF-kappaB activation (17,18). In un-stimulated cells, the p65 DNA binding (Figure 2A) and nuclear p65 (Figure 2B, nucleus) were slightly enhanced by Tat, while the IkappaB-alpha content was not significantly affected (Figure 2B, cytosol). Transient stimulation with PMA increased the NF-kappaB DNA binding activity and nuclear p65 at 5 min peaking at 60-120 min independently of the presence of Tat (Figure 2A and B); however, while the p65 DNA binding and nuclear p65 persisted elevated at 240-min post-treatment in Tat-positive cells, they dropped in Tat-negative cells (Figure 2A and B). In addition, Tat bound to the NF-kappaB oligonucleotide in un-stimulated cells and its binding increased following PMA stimulation (Figure 2A), suggesting that the viral protein was a component of the NF-kappaB complex bound to DNA. Degradation of IkappaB-alpha was progressively induced at 5-30 min, followed by de novo synthesis at 60 min with full replenishment at 240 min in both Tat-positive and negative cells (Figure 2B, cytosol). Consistently, the IKK activation started at 5 min, and turned off at 30 min independently of the presence of Tat (Figure 2C). These results indicated that Tat enhanced the NF-kappaB activity in un-stimulated and PMA-stimulated cells without affecting the IKK activity and IkappaB-alpha content.
As we previously found that Tat binds to the sixth ankyrin of IkappaB-alpha (50,51), we tested whether Tat counteracted the generation of the IkappaB-alpha/NF-kappaB complex. To this end, the association of IkappaB-alpha with p65 was analysed in vivo at 0 and 240 min after short-pulse PMA, which corresponded to the time of un-stimulated condition and post-activation de novo synthesis of IkappaB-alpha, respectively. Coimmunoprecipitation of IkappaB-alpha with p65 was detected at 0- and 240-min post-treatment in Tat-negative cells (Figure 2D, lanes 1 and 3), and was halved in Tat-positive cells, where Tat coimmunoprecipitated with IkappaB-alpha (Figure 2D, lanes 2 and 4), indicating that Tat competed the IkappaB-alpha binding to p65.
