NF-kappaB Activation
NF-kappaB binding activity in nuclear extracts was determined using an ELISA-based kit (Trans-AM p65, Active Motif, Rixensart, Belgium). In brief, 5 microg of nuclear extracts were incubated with a plate coated with an NF-kappaB consensus oligonucleotide. Plates were washed before addition of an anti-p65 antibody. Antibody binding was detected with a secondary HRP-conjugated antibody and developed with TMB substrate. The intensity of the reaction was measured at 450 nm.
