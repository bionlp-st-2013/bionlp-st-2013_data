Fluticasone propionate impairs GATA-3 interaction with importin-alpha and GATA-3 nuclear localization in vivo and ex vivo.
(A and B) Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of PBMCs from steroid-naive asthma patients treated with FP in vitro demonstrated impaired interaction between GATA-3 and importin-alpha measured at 60 min. Each bar represents the mean+/-SEM of at least three independent experiments; *** p<0.001 compared with control as determined by ANOVA/Newman-Keuls analysis. (C and D) Co-immunoprecipitation analyses of PBMCs from steroid-naive asthma patients treated with inhaled FP (500 microg via a spacer) in vivo demonstrated decreased association between GATA-3 and importin-alpha. The individual values for each treatment are presented graphically. (E) Representative Western blot showing that importin-alpha expression was unaffected by inhalation of FP. Blot is representative of gels from three participants.
