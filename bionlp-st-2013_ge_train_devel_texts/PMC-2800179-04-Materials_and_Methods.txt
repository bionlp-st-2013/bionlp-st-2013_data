Evaluation of Colitis
Body weight, liquid and food consumption, diarrhea and rectal bleeding (detected by eye inspection) were recorded throughout the feeding period. After 55 days, animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The length of the colon was measured as described by Okayashu et al. [24]. Then, each colon was ligated in sections of 2 cm and 1 to 2 ml of 10% formalin was infused into the intestinal lumen. The moderately distended segment was sectioned and fixed in 10% formalin. The following day, the intestinal content was removed by vortexing. The fixed segment was kept in 10% formalin at 4degreesC until the paraffin embedding procedure. To evaluate the degree of inflammation, this segment of colon was opened longitudinally and macroscopic and histological scores of inflammation were recorded as previously described [25], [26]. The toluidine blue staining was used for identification of sulphated polysaccharides in the intestinal mucosa. On the day of sacrifice, a fresh sample of each colon (50 mg) was collected for myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay according to Krawisz et al., [27]. The level of MPO, mainly expressed by neutrophils, indicates the rate of recruitment of neutrophils to the intestinal mucosa. One unit of MPO activity corresponds to the degradation of 1 micromol of peroxide per minute at 25degreesC.
