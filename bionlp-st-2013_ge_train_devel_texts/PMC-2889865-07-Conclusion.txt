In the present study, IL-6 release was found to be associated with NF-kappaB activity while CXCL8 release more closely correlated with AP-1 activity. Treatment of Jurkat T-cells with PMA was more potent than HK E. coli at elevating the CXCL8 levels. PMA induced AP-1 activation and down-regulated NF-kappaB while HK E. coli up-regulated NF-kappaB without affecting AP-1 activity. In addition, the temporal induction pattern of AP-1 correlated to the release of CXCL8 while IL-6 followed the NF-kappaB activity. Likewise, blocking NF-kappaB activation resulted in a complete inhibition of IL-6 while the CXCL8 levels remained elevated as shown both at the protein and mRNA level. Furthermore, the CXCL8 release was down-regulated by inhibition of JNK activity. The present study indicates that in Jurkat T-cells, IL-6 is regulated through NF-kappaB while CXCL8 regulation is independent of NF-kappaB and closely associated with AP-1 activation.
