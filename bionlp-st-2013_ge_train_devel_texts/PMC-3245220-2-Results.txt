M-CSF Induces NF-==kappa==B Transcriptional Activity in Human Monocyte-Derived Macrophages (MDMs) and Mouse Macrophage Cell Line, RAW 264.7
To determine if M-CSF induced NF-==kappa==B DNA binding in human macrophages, we performed EMSA analysis on nuclear lysates from M-CSF-treated MDMs. Similar to previous reports [11], nuclear NF-==kappa==B constitutively bound DNA in non-stimulated monocytes (Figure 1A). Interestingly, adding M-CSF did not alter NF-==kappa==B DNA binding by EMSA. In contrast, after transiently transfecting human MDMs with pNF-==kappa==B-SEAP constructs containing four NF-==kappa==B consensus binding sequences, M-CSF treatment of the transfected cells resulted in a 2.3-fold increase in SEAP release in the culture media compared to PBS (vehicle)-treated transfected MDMs (Figure 1B). As a control, the pTAL-SEAP construct lacking NF-==kappa==B binding sites was used. Cells transfected with the pTAL-SEAP construct did not produce SEAP in the absence or presence of M-CSF (Figure 1B).
We next investigated whether M-CSF induced NF-==kappa==B activity in the mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with either the NF-==kappa==B-SEAP reporter or control pTAL-SEAP construct. As shown in Figure 1C, M-CSF treatment of RAW 264.7 cells increased NF-==kappa==B reporter activity by 2.5-fold over that of non-treated cells. Together, our data demonstrate that M-CSF induced NF-==kappa==B transcriptional activity in macrophages.
