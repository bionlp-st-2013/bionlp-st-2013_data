Normal TLR4 and MD2 expression and decreased IL10 secretion and A20 expression by cpdm BMDC.
(A) Unstimulated WT and cpdm BMDC (5x105) were labeled with PE-labeled anti-TLR4/MD2 or anti-CD14 and then subject to flow cytometry analysis. Unstained cells serve as negative controls. (B) Cultured WT and cpdm BMDC (1x105 cells in 0.1 ml complete medium) were washed and stimulated with medium, 100 ng/ml LPS or 25 microg/ml poly I:C for 24 hours. Supernatants were collected for ELISA of IL10. (C) Cultured WT and cpdm BMDC (5x105 cells in 0.2 ml complete medium) were washed and stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS or 25 microg/ml poly I:C. At 0, 1, and 2 hours, total RNA was extracted and subject to qRT-PCR to measure the production of A20.
