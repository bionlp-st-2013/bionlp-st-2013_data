NF-==kappa==B p65 Ser276 is essential in regulating NF-==kappa==B activity.
(A) Raw 264.7 cell line was transiently transfected with pNF-==kappa==B-SEAP along with empty vector or plasmid encoding either NF-==kappa==B p65 WT or NF-==kappa==B p65 276S/A. The cells were transfected for 18-24 hours, serum starved for 4 hours, and then incubated with 10 ==micro==M of Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes prior to treatment with 100 ng/ml of M-CSF for 2 hours and SEAP secretion in the medium was measured. (B) NF-==kappa==B p65-/- cell line was transiently transfected with pNF-==kappa==B-SEAP along with empty vector or plasmid encoding either NF-==kappa==B p65 WT, NF-==kappa==B p65 276S/A, or NF-==kappa==B p65 536S/A. The cells were cultured for 24 hours and then serum starved for 4 hours. Cells were then incubated in fresh DMEM medium for 2 hours and SEAP secretion in the medium was measured. The results shown are fold change over empty vector + pTAL-SEAP. (C) NF-==kappa==B p65-/- cell line was transiently transfected with pNF-==kappa==B-SEAP with either empty vector or plasmid encoding either NF-==kappa==B p65 WT or NF-==kappa==B p65 276S/A. The cells were transfected for 24 hours and serum starved for 4 hours, and then incubated with 10 ==micro==M of Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes prior to treatment with 10 ng/ml of TNF==alpha==. The supernatant were collected after 2 hours of treatment and SEAP secretion in the medium was measured. The results shown are the fold change over empty vector + pNF-==kappa==B-SEAP. Data shown are mean +/- S.E.M for at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate.
