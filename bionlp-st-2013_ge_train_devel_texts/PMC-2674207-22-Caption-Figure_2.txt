Fluticasone propionate reduces GATA-3 association with importin-alpha and GATA-3 nuclear import.
(A) Western blot analysis demonstrates a time- (at 10-8 M FP) and concentration- (at 60 min after stimulation) dependent induction of FP-activated GR interaction with importin-alpha (Imp-alpha). A positive control for GR association with importin is shown. Quantification of the densitometry data is shown below. Each bar represents mean+/-SEM of at least three independent experiments. *** p<0.001 compared to control, ### p<0.001. (B) Western blot analysis demonstrated a time- (at 10-8 M FP) and concentration- (at 60 min after stimulation) dependent induction of FP-activated GR nuclear translocation measured by IP. Quantification of the densitometry data is shown below. Each bar represents mean+/-SEM of at least three independent experiments. ***p<0.001 compared to control. (C) Western blot analysis of HuT-78 cells treated with FP and anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulation demonstrated a concentration-dependent decrease in GATA-3-importin-alpha association at 20 min. Quantification of the densitometry data is shown below. Each bar represents mean+/-SEM of at least three independent experiments. ###p<0.001 compared to control, ***p<0.001 compared to alphaCD3/CD28-stimulated cells. (D) GFP-tagged GATA-3 was overexpressed and cells stimulated (b, c) or not (a) for 30 min with anti-CD3/CD28. The effect of 30 min pretreatment of cells with FP (10-8 M, c) is also shown. All data were analysed by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test.
