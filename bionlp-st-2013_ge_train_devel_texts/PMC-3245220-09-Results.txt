Identification of PKC==alpha== as the Upstream Activator of NF-==kappa==B in Myeloid Cells
Even though the PKC family consists of 10 members, finding that PKC==alpha==/==beta== inhibitors and intracellular calcium inhibitors reduced M-CSF-induced NF-==kappa==B activity, suggested PKC==alpha== was involved in NF-==kappa==B activation after M-CSF treatment. To confirm the role of PKC==alpha== in NF-==kappa==B activation in macrophages, constructs for either wildtype (WT)-PKC==alpha== or kinase-deficient (KD)-PKC==alpha== was co-transfected with the pNF-==kappa==B-SEAP reporter gene and SEAP secretion was measured. As shown in Figure 7A, MDMs co-transfected with pNF-==kappa==B-SEAP and WT-PKC==alpha== had a 1.8-fold increase in NF-==kappa==B transcriptional activity after M-CSF activation compared with NS cells (p = 0.05), similar to M-CSF-treated cells expressing only pNF-==kappa==B-SEAP. Transfecting human macrophages with the KD-PKC==alpha== construct significantly reduced M-CSF-induced NF-==kappa==B activity compared to WT-PKC==alpha== transfected cells (p = 0.016). Similarly, RAW 264.7 cells transfected with WT-PKC==alpha== had 2.5-fold more NF-==kappa==B transcriptional activity after M-CSF activation compared to unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells (NS) transfected with WT-PKC==alpha== (Figure 7B). Expression of the KD-PKC==alpha== construct into RAW 264.7 cells reduced M-CSF-induced NF-==kappa==B activity to 1.5-fold (p = 0.045) compared to cells transfected with WT PKC==alpha==.
Cell survival was also examined in MDMs expressing either WT-PKC==alpha== or KD-PKC==alpha== constructs by Annexin V-FITC and PI staining. As expected, M-CSF increased MDM survival as measured by the percent of Annexin V/PI negative cells. Similarly, expression of WT-PKC==alpha== protected cells from apoptosis. In contrast, expression of KD-PKC==alpha== decreased M-CSF-induced cell survival (p<0.01) (Figure 7C).
Next, we examined the effect of expressing the PKC==alpha== constructs on NF-==kappa==B phosphorylation. As shown in Figure 7D, expression of KD-PKC==alpha== in RAW 264.7 cells did not affect the constitutive phosphorylation at Ser536 of NF-==kappa==B p65, but attenuated the phosphorylation at Ser276. Expression of WT-PKC==alpha== did not effect the phosphorylation of either residue with or without M-CSF stimulation. These observations demonstrate that PKC==alpha== is important in M-CSF-regulated cell survival and NF-==kappa==B activation and likely regulated through phosphorylation of Ser276 of NF-==kappa==B p65.
To further validate the impact that PKC==alpha== played in M-CSF-induced NF-==kappa==B transcriptional activity, we next employed PKC==alpha== siRNA treatment of MDM or RAW cells. A pool of specific PKC==alpha== siRNA were transfected into MDM or Raw 264.7 cells in the presence or absence or M-CSF. Reducing native PKC==alpha== expression decreased M-CSF-induced NF-==kappa==B transcriptional activity in both MDM (Figure 7E) (p = 0.012) and Raw 264.7 cells (Figure 7F) (p = 0.01). We also examined cell survival of the MDMs by Annexin V-FITC and PI staining after PKC==alpha== siRNA transfection. As shown in Figure 7G, M-CSF-induced MDM survival was reduced in the cells transfected with PKC==alpha== siRNA compared with cells transfected with control siRNA (p = 0.047). In Figure 7H, we confirmed that PKC==alpha== siRNA transfection decreased PKC==alpha== protein expression in both MDM and Raw 264.7 cells. Our results indicated that PKC==alpha== regulated NF-==kappa==B activation and M-CSF-regulated cell survival.
