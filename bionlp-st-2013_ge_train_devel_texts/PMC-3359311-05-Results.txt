PBMCs from CF patients do not produce increased amounts of IL-1beta upon inflammasome stimulation
Previous studies have shown that the loss of CFTR results in increased NF-kappaB activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion [4], [5], [32], [36], [37]. To further examine this relationship, PBMCs from CF patients and healthy adult controls were stimulated with PAO1, LPS+ATP, and LPS+Poly(dA:dT), to activate the NLRC4, NLRP3, and AIM2 inflammasomes, respectively. By 24 hours of stimulation, CF PBMCs did not produce increased amounts of IL-1beta (Fig. 5a) or IL-8 (Fig. 5b) when compared to healthy controls. However, we did notice a transient decrease (P<0.001) in the amount of IL-1beta produced by CF cells in response to LPS+ATP at 6 hours (data not shown). Stimulation of PBMCs with P. aeruginosa that lacks exsA (PAO1deltaexsA), a key regulator of type III secretion, produced three-fold less IL-1beta compared to the parental PAO1 strain by 24 hours (Fig. 5a). Inflammasome stimulation without priming did not result in any IL-1beta production in either CF or control PBMCs. Contrary to our hypothesis, these results indicate that PBMCs from CF patients do not display increased production of IL-1beta or IL-8 with inflammasome activation nor do they suggest any increased basal or induced NF-kappaB activity. These results are consistent with our observation that caspase-1 activity is not different between CF and control PBMCs (Fig. 4).
