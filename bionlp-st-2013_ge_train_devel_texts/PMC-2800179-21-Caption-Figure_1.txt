Degraded CGN induced colon inflammation in rats.
Histograms showing the effect of degraded CGN on: colon length (A); macroscopic (B) and histological (C) inflammation score of colon; Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (D). Control rats (white bars); 10 kDa degraded CGN-treated rats (grey bars); 40 kDa degraded CGN-treated rats (black bars). * p<0.05 from control. ** p<0.01 from control. Histological analysis of colon from control rats (E), and from 40 kDa dCGN-treated rats (F).
