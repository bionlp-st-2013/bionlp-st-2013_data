Regulation of AP-1 and NF-kappaB activation
The transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1 play key roles in the initiation of an inflammatory response by inducing the expression and secretion of chemokines and cytokines that attract and activate immune cells. However, the signal transduction pathways and subsequent inflammatory cytokine induction by these transcription factors is not fully elucidated. The present study is aimed at determining the involvement of AP-1 and NF-kappaB in cytokine induction and regulation. PMA treatment resulted in an up-regulation of AP-1 after 2 h exposure and continued to increase throughout the analysis period (figure 1a). HK E. coli treatment did not affect AP-1 activation in Jurkat T-cells (figure 1b). To determine the involvement of associated pathways, we exposed cells to Ca2+ ionophore with or without PMA and observed a modest involvement of Ca2+ in PMA-dependent AP-1 activation (figure 1c) while Ca2+ alone did not alter AP-1 activity (data not shown). Furthermore, AP-1 activity decreased in a TCR-deficient Jurkat cell line when exposed to PMA compared to the parent cell line indicating that regulation of AP-1 was only partially T-cell receptor dependent (figure 1d).
NF-kappaB levels showed a transient increase at 1 min after exposure to PMA (figure 2a). However, 1 h after exposure the NF-kappaB levels began to drop reaching the lowest levels by 6 h, after which they increased again by 24 h. Exposure of Jurkat T-cells to HK E. coli resulted in a dose-dependent NF-kappaB activation, with the highest activity observed at a relative concentration of 5 x 107 CFU/ml (figure 2b). The time-dependent activation of NF-kappaB by HK E. coli was assessed further using the optimal concentration obtained from figure 2b and showed that the NF-kappaB activity increased after 3 h of exposure (figure 2c). Furthermore, increased intracellular Ca2+ reversed the PMA dependent NF-kappaB inhibition (figure 2d) and reduced the HK E. coli -dependent NF-kappaB activation (figure 2e).
