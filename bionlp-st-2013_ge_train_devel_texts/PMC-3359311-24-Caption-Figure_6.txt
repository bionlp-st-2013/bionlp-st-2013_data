NF-kappaB activation potentiates the degree of IL-1beta production and secretion upon inflammasome activation.
THP-1 reporter cells were primed overnight with heat-killed P. aeruginosa and stimulated the next day with live P. aeruginosa or additional heat-killed P. aeruginosa for the times indicated. Cell culture supernatants were assayed for (A) NF-kappaB/AP-1 activity, (B) IL-8, and (C) IL-1beta secretion (n = 3-6 experiments). Using the same stimulation method, THP-1 reporter cells were treated with Bay11-7082 (20 microM) for 1 hour prior to priming with heat-killed PAO1 or live PAO1. Supernatants were assayed at 24 hours for (D) NF-kappaB/AP-1 activity, (E) IL-8, and (F) IL-1beta secretion (n = 3-5). PBMCs from CF patients (n = 11-15) and controls (n = 10-13) were treated with z-YVAD-fmk (20 microM) or Bay11-7082 (10 microM) and stimulated with live PAO1 (MOI = 1), ATP (5 mM), or Poly(dA:dT) (1 microg/ml) according to the schedule in Figure 1. (G) IL-1beta and (H) IL-8 levels were measured at 24 hours. Statistical analysis was performed using two way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. *, **, and *** signify P<0.05, 0.01, and 0.001.
