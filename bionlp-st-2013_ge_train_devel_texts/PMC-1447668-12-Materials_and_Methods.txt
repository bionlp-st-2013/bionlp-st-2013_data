Plasmids.
Expression vectors encoding human Foxp3 (pCMV-Foxp3-IRES-EGFP) and human Foxp3 lacking the forkhead (FKH) domain (pCMV-deltaFKH-IRES-EGFP) were generous gifts from S. Ziegler (Benaroya Research Institute). pEGFP-C2 was provided by I. Lipinski (NIDDK/NIH). pcDNA3 was provided by K. T. Jeang (NIAID/NIH). pCMV4-Tax was a generous gift from W. Greene (University of California San Francisco). pGL4-luc2 and pGL4-TKhRluc2 were purchased from Promega (Madison, Wisconsin, United States). pUC18 was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, California, United States). HIV-1 wt LTR and HIV-1 delta-kappaB LTR luciferase reporter vectors were constructed by cloning the XhoI/HindIII LTR fragments from pHIV-CAT and pdelta-kappaB-HIV-CAT (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, NIAID/NIH) into the multiple cloning site of pGL4-luc2. NF-kappaB, HTLV-I LTR, and CREB luciferase reporter and pCMV-p300-HA expression vectors were generously provided by B. Wigdahl (Drexel University College of Medicine). HTLV-I pACH infectious molecular clone has been described previously [30]. pFR-luc, pFA-CMV, pFA2-CREB-1, and pFA2-c-Jun were purchased from Stratagene. pFA-Tax (encoding a fusion protein consisting of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused in-frame to HTLV-I Tax) was constructed by PCR amplification of HTLV-I Tax using pCMV4-Tax as a template and BamHI/BglII-tagged primers. The amplified insert was digested and ligated into the BamHI/BglII sites of pFA-CMV. Plasmid contents were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
