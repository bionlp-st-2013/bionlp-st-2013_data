PKC is Essential in Regulating NF-==kappa==B Activity
M-CSF-dependent PKC activity facilitated NF-==kappa==B p65 phosphorylation at Ser276 but not Ser536. To confirm the role of PKC and p65 Ser276 phosphorylation on NF-==kappa==B activity, we co-transfected the NF-==kappa==B-SEAP construct with either WT NF-==kappa==B p65 or NF-==kappa==B p65 276S/A constructs in Raw 264.7 cells, then treated cells with the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 in the absence or presences of M-CSF. As expected in cells transfected with vector control, inhibiting PKC reduced M-CSF-stimulated NF-==kappa==B activity compared to cells treated with M-CSF and the vehicle DMSO (p = 0.001) (Figure 8A). In contrast, expressing WT NF-==kappa==B p65 (p65 WT) increased NF-==kappa==B activity, while the general PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 decreased this NF-==kappa==B activity (p = 0.001). Notably, the introduction of NF-==kappa==B p65 276 S/A construct significantly reduced NF-==kappa==B activity compared with the WT NF-==kappa==B p65 construct (p = 0.005) and M-CSF treatment was unable to overcome this inhibition.
Furthermore, we co-transfected the NF-==kappa==B-SEAP construct along with either the WT NF-==kappa==B p65, NF-==kappa==B p65 276S/A or NF-==kappa==B p65 536S/A constructs into a NF-==kappa==B p65-/- murine fibroblast cell line and measured NF-==kappa==B activity. As predicted, expression of WT NF-==kappa==B p65 (p65 WT) in NF-==kappa==B p65-/- cell line constitutively activated NF-==kappa==B compared to cells transfected with vector control without any stimulation (Figure 8B). In comparison, transfecting the NF-==kappa==B p65 276S/A construct reduced NF-==kappa==B activity by 5-fold (p = 0.006, WT NF-==kappa==B p65 vs. NF-==kappa==B p65 276S/A), while expressing the NF-==kappa==B p65 536S/A construct increased NF-==kappa==B activity in the p65-/- cells to levels similar to WT NF-==kappa==B p65 transfected cells.
Since M-CSF-induced PKC activation regulated NF-==kappa==B activity via Ser276 residue of NF-==kappa==B p65 in primary human MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells, we next examined if this occurred in NF-==kappa==B p65-/- fibroblasts in response to a native stimulus for these cells, TNF==alpha==. NF-==kappa==B activity was measured in the WT NF-==kappa==B p65 or NF-==kappa==B p65 276S/A transfected cells treated with TNF==alpha== in the absence or presence of Ro-31-8220 (Figure 8C). As expected, TNF==alpha== increased NF-==kappa==B activity in NF-==kappa==B p65-/- cells expressing WT p65 and (p = 0.001) PKC inhibitors decreased NF-==kappa==B activity to the non-stimulated (NS) level (p = 0.007). Introducing NF-==kappa==B p65 276 S/A constructs significantly reduced NF-==kappa==B activity compared with the WT NF-==kappa==B p65 construct (p = 0.001). Notably, TNF==alpha== failed to increase NF-==kappa==B activity in the NF-==kappa==B p65-/- cells expressing NF-==kappa==B p65 276S/A constructs. These observations are similar to macrophages overexpressing the NF-==kappa==B p65 276S/A (Figure 8A). Our data demonstrate that Ser276 of NF-==kappa==B p65 is essential in regulating NF-==kappa==B activity and suggests that PKC regulates NF-==kappa==B activity by modulating the phosphorylation of NF-==kappa==B p65 at Ser276 residue.
