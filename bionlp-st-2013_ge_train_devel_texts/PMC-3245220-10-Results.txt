PKC is Essential in Regulating NF-kappaB Activity
M-CSF-dependent PKC activity facilitated NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation at Ser276 but not Ser536. To confirm the role of PKC and p65 Ser276 phosphorylation on NF-kappaB activity, we co-transfected the NF-kappaB-SEAP construct with either WT NF-kappaB p65 or NF-kappaB p65 276S/A constructs in Raw 264.7 cells, then treated cells with the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 in the absence or presences of M-CSF. As expected in cells transfected with vector control, inhibiting PKC reduced M-CSF-stimulated NF-kappaB activity compared to cells treated with M-CSF and the vehicle DMSO (p = 0.001) (Figure 8A). In contrast, expressing WT NF-kappaB p65 (p65 WT) increased NF-kappaB activity, while the general PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 decreased this NF-kappaB activity (p = 0.001). Notably, the introduction of NF-kappaB p65 276 S/A construct significantly reduced NF-kappaB activity compared with the WT NF-kappaB p65 construct (p = 0.005) and M-CSF treatment was unable to overcome this inhibition.
Furthermore, we co-transfected the NF-kappaB-SEAP construct along with either the WT NF-kappaB p65, NF-kappaB p65 276S/A or NF-kappaB p65 536S/A constructs into a NF-kappaB p65-/- murine fibroblast cell line and measured NF-kappaB activity. As predicted, expression of WT NF-kappaB p65 (p65 WT) in NF-kappaB p65-/- cell line constitutively activated NF-kappaB compared to cells transfected with vector control without any stimulation (Figure 8B). In comparison, transfecting the NF-kappaB p65 276S/A construct reduced NF-kappaB activity by 5-fold (p = 0.006, WT NF-kappaB p65 vs. NF-kappaB p65 276S/A), while expressing the NF-kappaB p65 536S/A construct increased NF-kappaB activity in the p65-/- cells to levels similar to WT NF-kappaB p65 transfected cells.
Since M-CSF-induced PKC activation regulated NF-kappaB activity via Ser276 residue of NF-kappaB p65 in primary human MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells, we next examined if this occurred in NF-kappaB p65-/- fibroblasts in response to a native stimulus for these cells, TNFalpha. NF-kappaB activity was measured in the WT NF-kappaB p65 or NF-kappaB p65 276S/A transfected cells treated with TNFalpha in the absence or presence of Ro-31-8220 (Figure 8C). As expected, TNFalpha increased NF-kappaB activity in NF-kappaB p65-/- cells expressing WT p65 and (p = 0.001) PKC inhibitors decreased NF-kappaB activity to the non-stimulated (NS) level (p = 0.007). Introducing NF-kappaB p65 276 S/A constructs significantly reduced NF-kappaB activity compared with the WT NF-kappaB p65 construct (p = 0.001). Notably, TNFalpha failed to increase NF-kappaB activity in the NF-kappaB p65-/- cells expressing NF-kappaB p65 276S/A constructs. These observations are similar to macrophages overexpressing the NF-kappaB p65 276S/A (Figure 8A). Our data demonstrate that Ser276 of NF-kappaB p65 is essential in regulating NF-kappaB activity and suggests that PKC regulates NF-kappaB activity by modulating the phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 at Ser276 residue.
