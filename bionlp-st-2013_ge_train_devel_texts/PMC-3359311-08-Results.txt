Disruption of CFTR activity does not increase IL-1beta production in PBMCs and THP-1 cells
A previous study has indicated a role for chloride ion concentration in suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation [34]. To determine whether CFTR dysfunction alters IL-1beta production, THP-1 cells and PBMCs from CF patients and healthy controls were treated with the CFTR inhibitor, CFTRinh172, prior to simulation with live P. aeruginosa. Treatment with CFTRinh172 did not alter IL-1beta or IL-8 production in control subjects or CF patients (Fig. 8a-b). Similarly, IL-1beta production was not different in monocyte-derived macrophages or THP-1 reporter cells treated with CFTRinh172 (Fig. 8c-d). IL-8 (Fig. 8e) and NF-kappaB activity (Fig. 8f) were also unchanged in CFTRinh172-treated THP-1 reporter cells.
