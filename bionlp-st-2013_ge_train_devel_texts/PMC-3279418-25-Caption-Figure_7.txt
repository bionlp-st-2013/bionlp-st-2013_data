Stimulated cpdm BMDC induced Th2-biased cytokine production from naive CD4+ T cells.
WT and cpdm BMDC (5x104 cells in 0.1 mL complete medium; MHC haplotype: H-2b) were incubated with medium, 100 ng/mL LPS, 25 microg/mL poly I:C or 5 microg/mL Pam3CYS. After 24 hours, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with freshly isolated allogeneic naive CD4+ T cells (2.5x105 cells in 0.1 mL complete medium; MHC haplotype: H-2d). After 5 days, supernatants were collected and the secretion of IFNgamma, IL4, and IL2 were measured by ELISA. Negative controls are 1) stimulated BMDC without co-culture with allogeneic CD4+ T cells; 2) allogeneic CD4+ T cells without co-culture with stimulated BMDC. Samples from both negative controls had no detectable production of the aforementioned cytokines (not shown). Results are analyzed based on 2-4 mice per group. * P<0.05.
