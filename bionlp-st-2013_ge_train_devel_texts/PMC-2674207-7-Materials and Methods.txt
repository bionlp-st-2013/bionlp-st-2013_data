Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed as previously described [12] in HuT-78 T-cells with 2 ==micro==g of anti-GATA-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or isotypic immunoglobulin G as a non-specific control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4==degrees==C. Promoter sequences were detected with PCR primers for the IL-5 promoter (-445 to +4): forward 5'-TTAATCTAGCCACAGTCATAG-3' and reverse: 5'-TCATGGCTCTGAAACGTTCTG-3'. PCR was performed using a Hybaid Omnigene thermal cycler (Hybaid, Ashford, UK) with cycling parameters of 72==degrees==C for 10 min, 35 cycles at 94==degrees==C for 45 s, 52==degrees==C for 45 s, 72==degrees==C for 45 s.
