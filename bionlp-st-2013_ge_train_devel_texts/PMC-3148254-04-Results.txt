HOIP mediates CD40-stimulated NF-kappaB and JNK activation
The results described above show that HOIP plays an important role in CD40-mediated effector functions of B cells. It follows that HOIP is likely a key mediator of CD40 signaling. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated A20.2J and HOIP-deficient cells with CD154 (CD40 ligand) expressed by HI5 insect cells [7], [8] and measured activation of the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways, two of the major transcriptional regulators activated by CD40 [4]. Cell-associated CD154 was used as the stimulus in these experiments as it typically provides more robust, and therefore more readily detected, activation signals than does anti-CD40 antibody. Activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway is initiated with the phosphorylation of IkappaB proteins by the IkappaB kinase complex (IKK). In resting cells, IkappaB proteins are responsible for sequestering NF-kappaB subunits in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation by the IKK complex targets IkappaB proteins for ubiquitination and degradation, allowing NF-kappaB to enter the nucleus and activate gene expression. CD40-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha in HOIP-deficient cells was dramatically impaired relative to that observed in parental A20.2J cells (Fig. 4). We also assayed activation of the stress-activated protein kinase JNK in response to CD40 engagement (Fig. 4). CD40-mediated JNK activation in HOIP-deficient cells was impaired as measured by phosphorylation of Thr183 and Tyr185 in JNK. CD40-induced activation of NF-kappaB and JNK in HOIP-reconstituted cells was normal, demonstrating that the defects observed in gene-deficient cells were due to the absence of HOIP expression.
