NF-kappaB and PKC(s) Mediate Human MDM Survival in Response to M-CSF Stimulation
Since PKC and NF-kappaB are critical in cell survival [37], [38], we hypothesized that M-CSF promoted cell survival through PKC in human MDMs. To detect apoptosis, the expression of cleaved caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis, was analyzed in the presence or absence of M-CSF and PKC inhibitors. In MDMs pretreated with PKC inhibitors (Ro-31-8220, Go-6976, or BAPTA/AM) and stimulated with M-CSF, cleaved caspase-3 was elevated to levels of cells treated with vehicle alone (Figure 3A). In contrast, cells incubated with M-CSF and vehicle had less cleaved caspase-3 than cells incubated with vehicle alone or M-CSF with PKC inhibitors. These data supported the hypothesis that M-CSF-induced NF-kappaB activity was regulated by conventional PKCs, not novel PKCs.
To confirm that PKC inhibition decreased cell survival, cells were treated with M-CSF in the absence or presence of PKC inhibitors and then also examined for apoptosis by Annexin V/PI staining. PKC inhibitors in the presence of M-CSF reduced the number of Annexin V/PI negative MDMs compared to cells treated with M-CSF alone (Figure 3B). These observations further suggested that MDM survival is promoted by M-CSF and critically involves conventional PKCs and NF-kappaB activity.
