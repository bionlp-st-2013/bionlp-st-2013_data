2.1Cell culture, transient transfections and cell stimulation
The generation, culture and activation of PKD1-/-, PKD3-/- and PKD1/3-/- knockout DT40 B cell lines have been described previously [1]. Cells were lysed and protein extracts were analysed in Western blotting experiments as previously described [1]. Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase assays have been described previously [29].
