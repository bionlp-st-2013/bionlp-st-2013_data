Cells, transfection, treatments and luciferase assay
HeLa, p50-/-p65-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (52) and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Jurkat, U937 cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultured in RPMI 1640. PBMCs were isolated as previously described (53). Media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 2 mM l-glutamine (Lonza Cologne AG, Germany). HeLa, p50-/-p65-/- MEFs and 293T were transfected with DNA by using FuGENE HD (Roche Diagnostic GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), according to the manufacturer's protocol; total DNA amounts were equalized by transfection of pRc/CMV empty vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For pulse-stimulation, HeLa cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) (20 ng/ml) for 5 min, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; Sigma-Aldrich) (20 ng/ml) for 30 min, washed twice in complete culture medium and then returned to culture. For luciferase assays, pSV-beta-Gal was co-transfected with pkappaBluc to monitor the transfection efficiency. Forty-eight-hour post-transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer of Dual Light Luciferase System (Tropix, Bedford, MA, USA) and the luciferase and beta-galactosidase activities were evaluated by using Dual Light Luciferase System (Tropix) in a bioluminometer (Turner Biosystem, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The ratio of firefly luciferase activity to beta-galactosidase activity was expressed as relative light units.
