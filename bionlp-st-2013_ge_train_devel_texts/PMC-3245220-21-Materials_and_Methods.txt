Analysis of PKCalpha Kinase Activity
Human MDMs were starved for 2 hours before stimulation with M-CSF (0-60 minutes), then washed with cold PBS and removed from the plates. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 20 mM beta-glycerol phosphate, 1 mM PMSF 2 microg/ml aprotinin and 2 microg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.5), sonicated and centrifuged to obtain whole cell lysates, which were then immunoprecipitated with anti-PKCalpha antibody and protein G-agarose (Invitrogen). Immune complexes were washed twice, and PKCalpha activity was analyzed by non-radioactive Peptag assay kit (Promega). Briefly, kinase buffer, activator, peptide protection solution and Peptag peptide were incubated with the immune complexes at 30degreesC for 30 minutes. Reactions were stopped by boiling for 10 minutes and samples were separated on 0.8% agarose gel. Phosphorylated peptide migrated toward the anode (+), while non-phosphorylated peptide migrated toward the cathode (-). Fluorescein-tagged peptides were visualized by UV light.
