Age- and gender-matched normal B6 mice received every other day intraperitoneal (ip) injections of PBS, 1.5 mug rmIL-4, 50 mug anti-IL-4 mAb (11B11 or MAB404), or a mixture of 1.5 mug rmIL-4 plus 50 mug anti-IL-4 mAb (11B11 or MAB404) for 7 d. Thereafter, spleen and lymph node cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for CD3, CD4, and CD25 expression. The anti-mouse IL-4 mAb MAB404 was obtained from R&D Systems, the second anti-mouse IL-4 mAb 11B11 was purchased from eBioscience.
