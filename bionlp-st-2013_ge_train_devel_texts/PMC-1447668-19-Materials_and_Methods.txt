Flow cytometric analysis of Foxp3 protein expression.
Cryopreserved PBMCs from HAM/TSP patients or HTLV-I-infected ACs were thawed and washed with FACS buffer (1x PBS, 0.1% NaN3, 5% FBS). Cells (1.5 x 106) were fixed by sequential formaldehyde/methanol fixation as follows. Cells were carefully resuspended in FACS buffer and fixed with 100 mul of reagent A (Fix & Perm kit; Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, California, United States) at room temperature for 3 min followed by 2 ml of 70% methanol for 5 min at 4 degreesC. Cells were washed twice and permeabilized with 100 mul of reagent B (Fix & Perm kit) and stained for intracellular Foxp3 with mouse anti-human Foxp3 monoclonal antibody (0.5 mug of ab22510; Abcam) or the appropriate isotype control for 30 min. Cells were washed twice and stained with Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin F(ab')2 secondary antibody (Caltag Laboratories) for an additional 30 min. Cells were washed twice and stained for surface CD4 expression with PE-labeled anti-CD4 (BD) and CD25 expression with FITC-labeled anti-CD25 (BD). Cells were washed twice and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD). Data analysis was performed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Ashland, Oregon, United States).
