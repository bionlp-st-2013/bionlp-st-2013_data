IKKbeta phosphorylates RPS3 at serine 209
Although originally defined as the kinase that phosphorylates IkappaB19, IKKbeta also phosphorylates unrelated substrates including 14-3-3beta and Bcl10, which lack the IKK consensus motif (DpSGYXpS/T)28. We therefore hypothesized that IKKbeta could directly phosphorylate RPS3. By in vitro kinase assays using recombinant IKK and RPS3 proteins, we observed strong incorporation of 32P in autophosphorylatd IKKalpha and IKKbeta (Fig. 4a, lanes 2-7) as well as phosporylated GST-IkappaBalpha (1-54) (Supplementary Fig. 4), but not the GST protein alone (Fig. 4a, lanes 3 and 6), when either IKKalpha or IKKbeta was used. We discovered that GST-RPS3 could be phosphorylated by IKKbeta, but not IKKalpha, in vitro (Fig. 4a, compare lanes 4 and 7).
To identify the RPS3 amino acid residue(s) phosphorylated by IKKbeta, we performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses using in vitro phosphorylated RPS3. The results indicated that IKKbeta phosphorylated S209, located in the RPS3 C-terminus (Fig. 4b). RPS3 amino acid sequence alignment revealed that S209 is conserved in many species throughout phylogeny with the exception of Caenorhabditis elegans and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, two organisms that do not possess the NF-kappaB signal pathway (Supplementary Fig. 5).
To verify biochemically that S209 is an IKKbeta substrate, we performed 32P-labeling in vitro kinase assays with recombinant wild-type or S209A mutant RPS3 proteins. Compared with the wild-type protein, the S209A mutation reduced IKKbeta-mediated RPS3 phosphorylation (Fig. 4c). There might be alternative phosphorylation site(s) under these conditions given modest residual phosphorylated RPS3 (Fig. 4c). RPS3 S209 does not fall within a conventional IKK recognition motif, but rather resides in a sequence motif (XXXpS/TXXE), potentially recognized by casein kinase II (CK2). Although IKKbeta kinase can display a CK2-like phosphorylation specificity29, no CK2 protein was detectable in our recombinant IKK proteins (Supplementary Fig. 6). Thus, RPS3 S209 phosphorylation was due to the alternate specificity of the IKKbeta kinase rather than any trace amount of CK2 bound to IKKs. To determine whether S209 is the critical site at which IKKbeta phosphorylates RPS3 in living cells, we transfected the wild-type or S209A mutant Flag-RPS3 alone, or together with IKKbeta into cells. Indeed, we observed that overexpressing IKKbeta enhanced Flag-RPS3 phosphorylation, but phosphorylation was effectively eliminated by alanine substitution indicating that S209 is the predominant target site for IKKbeta phosphorylation (Fig. 4d). We next generated a phospho-S209 RPS3 antibody and confirmed that endogenous RPS3 was phosphorylated at S209 in a time-dependent manner upon TNF stimulation (Fig. 4e). Thus, the RPS3 C-terminal tail potentially contains an important regulatory site.
