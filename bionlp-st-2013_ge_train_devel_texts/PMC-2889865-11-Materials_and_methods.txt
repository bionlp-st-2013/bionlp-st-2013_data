Multiplex cytokine assay
Quantification of the levels of cytokines IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF and the chemokine CXCL8 was performed on culture supernatants using multiplexed biomarker immunoassay kits according to manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). A Bio-Plex(TM) 200 readout System was used (Bio-Rad), which utilizes Luminex(R) xMAP(TM) fluorescent bead-based technology (Luminex Corp., Austin). Levels were automatically calculated from standard curves using Bio-Plex Manager software (v.4.1.1, Bio-Rad).
