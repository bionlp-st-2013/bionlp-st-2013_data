IkappaBalpha degradation and RPS3 nuclear translocation
Importin-alpha regulates the nuclear import of NF-kappaB Rel subunits23, 24. RPS3 harbors a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence and its nuclear translocation occurs in parallel to, but independently of, p65 translocation6. We envisioned that RPS3 could also utilize the importin-alpha/beta pathway. Consistent with this notion, RPS3 association with importin-alpha, but not importin-beta, was enhanced in TNF-stimulated cells (Fig. 3a). Therefore, we examined whether RPS3 binding to importin-alpha is essential for nuclear translocation during NF-kappaB activation.
Since IkappaBalpha degradation is a prerequisite to unmask the NLS of p65, and both RPS3 and IkappaBalpha bind to p65 in the cytoplasmic inhibitory complex, we tested whether IkappaBalpha degradation is required for the liberation of RPS3. We measured the association of RPS3 with importin-alpha in 293T cells overexpressing wild-type IkappaBalpha or an IkappaBalpha mutant (SSAA) resistant to IKKbeta-induced phosphorylation and degradation. In cells transfected with wild-type IkappaBalpha, TNF stimulation augmented the interaction of RPS3 and importin-alpha to a similar degree as in non-transfected cells. By contrast, we observed that the RPS3-importin-alpha association was abolished by the presence of non-degradable IkappaBalpha (Fig. 3b).
To examine whether IkappaBalpha is the only cytoplasmic barrier precluding RPS3 nuclear translocation, we measured both RPS3-importin-alpha association and nuclear RPS3 after reducing IkappaBalpha expression. Compared with nonspecific siRNA, siRNA targeting of IkappaBalpha completely depleted IkappaBalpha in Jurkat cells (Fig. 3c, input). Nevertheless, the RPS3-importin-alpha association was not augmented (Fig. 3c), nor was significant nuclear RPS3 detected (Fig. 3d). Moreover, cells treated with sodium pervanadate (Pv) to induce IkappaBalpha degradation through an IKK-independent mechanism25-27 did not show increased association between RPS3 and importin-alpha (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 3b) or nuclear accumulation of RPS3, despite complete IkappaBalpha degradation (Supplementary Fig. 3c). We further examined whether a subsequent NF-kappaB activation signal independently promotes the importin-alpha association and nuclear transport of RPS3 after IkappaBalpha degradation. We found that TNF stimulation following Pv treatment was required for the RPS3-importin-alpha association, comparable to TNF stimulation alone (Fig. 3e). Thus, IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation itself is required but not sufficient to cause RPS3 association with importin-alpha followed by nuclear translocation. Rather, an additional signal, potentially IKKbeta phosphorylation of RPS3, is required.
