Inducible murine Treg culture.
Naive CD4+ T cells (CD4+, CD62L+, and CD25-) were isolated from pooled lymph nodes and spleens by FACS (FACS Aria, BD Biosciences). 5 x 105 T cells were co-cultured with 2.5 x 104 bone marrow-derived dendritic cells [62] and 0.01 mug/ml OVA323-339 peptide (Ansynth) in the presence or absence of 20-ng/mul rhTGF-ss1 (Peprotech) in 48-well plates. After 4 d, cells were harvested and analyzed for intracellular FOXP3 expression by FACS or gene expression by quantitative RT-PCR.
