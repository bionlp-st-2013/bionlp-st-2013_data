Airway epithelial cells do not significantly upregulate caspase-1 activity in response to inflammasome stimulation
To examine if inflammasome activation occurs in these airway cells, caspase-1 activity was quantified by flow cytometry. There was no significant increase upon stimulation with live PAO1 or LPS+ATP at the times examined (Fig. 3a-b). Because previous studies have indicated a role for caspase-1 in the activation of NF-kappaB through Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling [35], we examined whether chemical inhibition of caspase-1 altered NF-kappaB-dependent IL-6 production in response to P. aeruginosa. However, treatment with the caspase-1 inhibitor z-YVAD-fmk (YVAD) did not decrease IL-6 secretion by airway epithelial cells (Fig. 3c).
