Transient Transfection of RAW 264.7 Cells
RAW 264.7 cells were seeded in 12-well plates in RPMI medium containing 5% FBS one day prior to transfection, Secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter plasmids pTAL-SEAP or pNF-kappaB-SEAP were transfected into cells using Qiagene Effectene or Attractene transfection kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For co-transfection studies, PKCalpha or NF-kappaB p65 constructs were mixed at a ratio of 5:1 with the reporter plasmid. For siRNA transfection, 100 nM of PKCalpha siRNA or control siRNA were used. Cells were incubated with the transfection reagents for 16-24 hours, washed and starved in RPMI without FBS for 4 hours. Samples were then stimulated with 100 ng/ml M-CSF for 4 hours at which point the medium was collected for the SEAP analysis. For inhibition studies, cells were pre-incubated with inhibitors for 30 minutes before M-CSF treatment. On average, we realized 30-40% transfection efficiency as confirmed by GFP expression in Raw 264.7 cells.
