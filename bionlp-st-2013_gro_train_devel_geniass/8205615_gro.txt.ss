Nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor 1 regulates the muellerian inhibiting substance gene: a link to the sex determination cascade.
Normal male sex differentiation requires that Sertoli cells in the embryonic testes produce muellerian inhibiting substance (MIS), a TGF beta-like hormone that causes muellerian duct regression.
In primary Sertoli cells, the orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), regulates the MIS gene by binding to a conserved upstream regulatory element.
In heterologous (HeLa) cells, MIS gene activation by SF-1 requires removal of the SF-1 ligand-binding domain, implicating a Sertoli cell-specific ligand or cofactor.
Finally, the sexually dimorphic expression of SF-1 during development coincides with MIS expression and muellerian duct regression.
We propose that SF-1 regulates MIS in vivo and participates directly in the process of mammalian sex determination.
