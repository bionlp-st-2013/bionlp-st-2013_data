Human TAF(II)135 potentiates transcriptional activation by the AF-2s of the retinoic acid, vitamin D3, and thyroid hormone receptors in mammalian cells.
We report for the first time the cloning of a complete cDNA encoding the human TFIID subunit hTAF(II)135 (hTAF(II)130).
Full-length hTAF(II)135 comprises 1083 amino acids and contains two conserved domains present also in dTAF(II)110 and hTAF(II)105.
We show that expression of hTAF(II)135 in mammalian cells strongly and selectively potentiates transcriptional stimulation by the activation function-2 (AF-2) of the retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D3 receptors (RAR, TR, and VDR), but does not affect the AF-2s of the estrogen (ER) or retinoid X (RXR) receptors.
The coactivator activity requires an hTAF(II)135 region that is located between the conserved domains but is itself not conserved in dTAF(II)110 and hTAF(II)105.
Expression of hTAF(II)135 also stimulates RAR AF-2 activity when a promoter with a low-affinity TATA element (TGTA) is used, indicating that hTAF(II)135 overexpression compensates for the low-affinity of TBP for this promoter and may facilitate the recruitment of TFIID by the RAR AF-2.
