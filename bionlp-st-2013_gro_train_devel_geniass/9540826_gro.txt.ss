Isolation and expression of a human SRY-related cDNA hSOX20.
SOX is a family of genes related to the testis-determining gene, SRY.
We have isolated and sequenced an hSOX20 cDNA from a cell line of human embryonic carcinoma.
This cDNA contains an open reading frame (ORF) encoding 233 amino acids.
The protein encompasses an SRY-type HMG box exhibiting strong homologies to those of mouse Sox15 and Sox16.
Various adult and fetal tissues were tested for hSOX20 mRNA by Northern analysis.
Its expression is restricted to the fetal testis and the size of the transcript is 1.5 knt.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated that recombinant hSOX20 polypeptide is capable of binding to AACAAT sequence.
