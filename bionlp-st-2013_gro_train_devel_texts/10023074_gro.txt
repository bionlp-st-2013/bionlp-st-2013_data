Duet is a novel serine/threonine kinase with Dbl - Homology (DH) and Pleckstrin - Homology (PH) domains. We show here the identification of Duet, a novel molecule bearing serine/threonine kinase, Dbl - Homology (DH), and Pleckstrin - Homology (PH) domains. The kinase domain of Duet shows a homology to that of DAP kinase that is involved in apoptosis, and Duet is autophosphorylated by an in - vitro kinase assay. The DH -  and PH - domains are closely related to those of Trio and Kalirin. Trad mRNA is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle. Duet protein was localized to actin - associated cytoskeletal elements. These data suggest a role of Duet in the cytoskeleton - dependent cell function.
