Cell adhesion regulates the interaction between the docking protein p130(Cas) and the 14 - 3 - 3 proteins. Integrin ligand binding induces a signaling complex formation via the direct association of the docking protein p130(Cas) (Cas) with diverse molecules. We report here that the 14 - 3 - 3zeta protein interacts with Cas in the yeast two - hybrid assay. We also found that the two proteins associate in mammalian cells and that this interaction takes place in a phosphoserine - dependent manner, because treatment of Cas with a serine phosphatase greatly reduced its ability to bind 14 - 3 - 3zeta. Furthermore, the Cas - 14 - 3 - 3zeta interaction was found to be regulated by integrin - mediated cell adhesion. Thus, when cells are detached from the extracellular matrix, the binding of Cas to 14 - 3 - 3zeta is greatly diminished, whereas replating the cells onto fibronectin rapidly induces the association. Consistent with these results, we found that the subcellular localization of Cas and 14 - 3 - 3 is also regulated by integrin ligand binding and that the two proteins display a significant co - localization during cell attachment to the extracellular matrix. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that 14 - 3 - 3 proteins participate in integrin - activated signaling pathways through their interaction with Cas, which, in turn, may contribute to important biological responses regulated by cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix.
