DLX2 (TES1), a homeobox gene of the Distal - less family, assigned to conserved regions on human and mouse chromosomes 2. Dlx - 2 (also called Tes - 1), a mammalian member of the Distal - less family of homeobox genes, is expressed during murine fetal development in spatially restricted domains of the forebrain. Searching for a candidate neurological mutation that might involve this gene, we have assigned the human and mouse loci to regions of conserved synteny on human chromosome 2, region cen -  - q33, and mouse chromosome 2 by Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrid lines. An EcoRI dimorphism, discovered in common inbred laboratory strains, was used for recombinant inbred strain mapping. The results place Dlx - 2/Tes - 1 near the Hox - 4 cluster on mouse chromosome 2.
