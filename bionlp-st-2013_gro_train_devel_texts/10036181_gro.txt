Discovery of three novel orphan G - protein - coupled receptors. We have discovered three novel human genes, GPR34, GPR44, and GPR45, encoding family A G - protein - coupled receptors (GPCRs). The receptor encoded by GPR34 is most similar to the P2Y receptor subfamily, while the receptor encoded by GPR44 is most similar to chemoattractant receptors. The receptor encoded by GPR45 is the mammalian orthologue of a putative lysophosphatidic acid receptor from Xenopus laevis. Partial sequence of GPR34 was discovered during a search of the GenBank database of expressed sequence tags (ESTs). This sequence information was used both to isolate the full - length translational open reading frame from a human genomic library and to assemble a contig from additional GPR34 EST cDNAs. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses revealed GPR34 mRNA transcripts in several human and rat brain regions. Also, we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify human genomic DNA using degenerate oligonucleotides designed from sequences encoding transmembrane domains 3 and 7 of opioid and somatostatin receptors. Two PCR products partially encoding novel GPCRs, named GPR44 and GPR45, were discovered and used to isolate the full - length translational open reading frames from a human genomic library. Both GPR44 and GPR45 are expressed in the central nervous system and periphery. For chromosomal localization, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was performed to assign GPR34 to chromosomes 4p12 and Xp11. 3, GPR44 to chromosome 11q12 - q13.3, and GPR45 to chromosome 2q11. 1 - q12.
