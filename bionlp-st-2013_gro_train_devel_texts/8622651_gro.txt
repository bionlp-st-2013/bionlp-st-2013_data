Activation of signalling by the activin receptor complex. Activin exerts its effects by simultaneously binding to two types of protein serine/threonine kinase receptors, each type existing in various isoforms. Using the ActR - IB and ActR - IIB receptor isoforms, we have investigated the mechanism of activin receptor activation. ActR - IIB are phosphoproteins with demonstrable affinity for each other. However, activin addition strongly promotes an interaction between these two proteins. Activin binds directly to ActR - IIB, and this complex associates with ActR - IB, which does not bind ligand on its own. In the resulting complex, ActR - IB becomes hyperphosphorylated, and this requires the kinase activity of ActR - IIB. Mutation of conserved serines and threonines in the GS domain, a region just upstream of the kinase domain in ActR - IB, abrogates both phosphorylation and signal propagation, suggesting that this domain contains phosphorylation sites required for signalling. ActR - IB activation can be mimicked by mutation of Thr - 206 to aspartic acid, which yields a construct, ActR - IB(T206D), that signals in the absence of ligand. Furthermore, the signalling activity of this mutant construct is undisturbed by overexpression of a dominant negative kinase - defective ActR - IIB construct, indicating that ActR - IB(T206D) can signal independently of ActR - IIB. The evidence suggests that ActR - IIB acts as a primary activin receptor and ActR - IB acts as a downstream transducer of activin signals.
