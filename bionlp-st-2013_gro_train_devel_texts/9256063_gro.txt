Human gene for the RNA polymerase II seventh subunit (hsRPB7): structure, expression and chromosomal localization. The human gene for the seventh largest subunit of RNA polymerase II complex, hsRPB7 was cloned, sequenced and mapped. This complex is an integral part of the transcription - coupled DNA repair mechanism and has been shown to be involved in several human genetic diseases and implicated in many others. The hsRPB7 gene consists of 8 exons and spans approximately 5.1 kb. Southern blots of genomic and cloned DNA suggest that hsRPB7 is coded for by a single gene. Using human radiation hybrids and YACs, the gene was localized to 11q13.1, within 70 kb of marker D11S1765. The sequence of the 5' flanking region does not contain a TATA element, but does contain several Sp1 binding sites, an AP - 1 site and a novel inverted polymorphic GATA tandem repeat. This novel GATA repeat can be used for linkage analysis. The hsRPB7 gene seems to be highly conserved among eukaryotic species, showing general sequence conservation to yeast and Drosophila. Northern blot analysis reveals a high degree of tissue - specific expression. For example, adult retina, brain and kidney exhibit a relatively high level of expression. A moderate level of expression is observed in heart, lung, testis, cornea, retinal pigmented epithelium/choroid and placenta with a lower level of expression in the uterus, small intestine and skeletal muscle. A very low level of expression was observed in stomach and liver. Comparison between four fetal and adult tissues also demonstrate a surprising level of developmental specificity. Expression in fetal retina is considerably lower than fetal brain but similar to adult retina.
