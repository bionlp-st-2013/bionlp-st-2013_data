Genomic organization and chromosomal localization of the gene TCF15 encoding the early mesodermal basic helix-loop-helix factor bHLH-EC2. bHLH-EC2 is a recently characterized member of a growing family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. This family includes bHLH factors such as twist, which appear to be primarily involved in early mesodermal differentiation, and bHLH factors such as TAL-1, which have been characterized through their association with chromosomal breakpoints associated with T-cell leukemias. To provide for studies aimed at understanding the genetic regulation of bHLH-EC2, we have characterized the organization of this gene and conducted preliminary studies of the transcriptional activity of the upstream promoter region. The mouse bHLH-EC2 gene was found to consist of two exons separated by a 5-kb intron, an organization pattern similar to the mouse twist gene. The transcription initiation site was identified by RNase protection assay and primer extension analysis. Linked promoter-reporter gene transfection experiments in cultured cells indicated that while the identified upstream sequence can function to promote transcription, it does not function in a cell-specific fashion. To investigate the possible association of bHLH-EC2 with hematological malignancy, the chromosomal location of this gene in the human was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization and assigned to chromosome band 20p13.
