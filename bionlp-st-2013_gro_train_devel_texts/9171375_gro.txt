Three human RNA polymerase III - specific subunits form a subcomplex with a selective function in specific transcription initiation. Transcription by RNA polymerase III involves recruitment of the polymerase by template - bound accessory factors, followed by initiation, elongation, and termination steps. An immunopurification approach has been used to demonstrate that human RNA Pol III is composed of 16 subunits, some of which are apparently modified in HeLa cells. Partial denaturing conditions and sucrose gradient sedimentation at high salt result in the dissociation of a subcomplex that includes hRPC32, hRPC39, and hRPC62. Cognate cDNAs were isolated and shown to encode three subunits that are specific to RNA Pol III and homologous to three yeast subunits. The human RNA Pol III core lacking the subcomplex functions in transcription elongation and termination following nonspecific initiation on a tailed template, but fails to show promoter - dependent transcription initiation in conjunction with accessory factors. The capability for specific transcription initiation can be restored either by the natural subcomplex or by a stable subcomplex composed of recombinant hRPC32, hRPC39, and hRPC62 polypeptides. One component (hRPC39) of this subcomplex interacts physically with both hTBP and hTFIIIB90, two subunits of human RNA Pol III transcription initiation factor IIIB. These data strongly suggest that the hRPC32 - hRPC39 - hRPC62 subcomplex directs RNA Pol III binding to the TFIIIB - DNA complex via the interactions between TFIIIB and hRPC39.
