Molecular cloning of cDNA encoding human Rab3D whose expression is upregulated with myeloid differentiation. To identify genes expressed in myeloid differentiation, we isolated a cDNA fragment by differential display using RNA prepared from HT93A cells, a human cell line capable of differentiating into neutrophil and eosinophil lineages in response to retinoic acid (RA). Evaluation of the full - length clone isolated from an HT93A cDNA library showed that it encoded a 24 kDa protein comprised of several domains conserved in the Ras superfamily. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of this clone with Rab proteins revealed that it had highest homology to a small GTP - binding protein, murine Rab3D. The mRNA expression of human Rab3D was upregulated in the course of myeloid differentiation, and it was preferentially expressed in granulocytes. These results suggest that human Rab3D may play a specific role in granulocytes, for example in exocytosis of neutrophil - specific granules or in degranulation of both eosinophils and basophils.
