Transcriptional repression by a novel member of the bZIP family of transcription factors. We describe here a novel member of the bZIP family of DNA - binding proteins, designated E4BP4, that displays an unusual DNA - binding specificity which overlaps that of the activating transcription factor family of factors. When expressed in a transient transfection assay with a suitable reporter plasmid, E4BP4 strongly repressed transcription in a DNA - binding - site - dependent manner. Examination of a series of deletion mutants revealed that sequences responsible for the repressing potential of E4BP4 lie within the carboxyl - terminal region of the protein. No similarity was found between this region and the repressing domains of other known eukaryotic transcriptional repressors.
