Identification of a human HECT family protein with homology to the Drosophila tumor suppressor gene hyperplastic discs. Use of the differential display technique to isolate progestin - regulated genes in T - 47D human breast cancer cells led to identification of a novel gene, EDD. The cDNA sequence contains a 2799 amino acid open reading frame sharing 40% identity with the predicted 2894 amino acid product of the Drosophila melanogaster tumor suppressor gene hyperplastic discs, while the carboxy - terminal 889 amino acids show 96% identity to a rat 100 kDa HECT domain protein. EDD mRNA was progestin - induced in T - 47D cells and was highly abundant in testes and expressed at moderately high levels in other tissues, suggesting a broad role for EDD. Anti - EDD antibodies immunoprecipitated an approximately 300 kDa protein from T - 47D cell lysates. HECT family proteins function as E3 ubiquitin - protein ligases, targeting specific proteins for ubiquitin - mediated proteolysis. EDD is likely to function as an E3 as in vitro translated protein bound ubiquitin reversibly through a conserved HECT domain cysteine residue. EDD was localized by FISH to chromosome 8q22, a locus disrupted in a variety of cancers. Given the homology between EDD and the hyperplastic discs protein, which is required for control of imaginal disc growth in Drosophila, EDD potentially has a role in regulation of cell proliferation or differentiation.
