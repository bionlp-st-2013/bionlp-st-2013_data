Mammalian staufen is a double - stranded - RNA -  and tubulin - binding protein which localizes to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Staufen (Stau) is a double - stranded RNA (dsRNA) - binding protein involved in mRNA transport and localization in Drosophila. To understand the molecular mechanisms of mRNA transport in mammals, we cloned human (hStau) and mouse (mStau) staufen cDNAs. In humans, four transcripts arise by differential splicing of the Stau gene and code for two proteins with different N - terminal extremities. In vitro, hStau and mStau bind dsRNA via each of two full - length dsRNA - binding domains and tubulin via a region similar to the microtubule - binding domain of MAP - 1B, suggesting that Stau cross - links cytoskeletal and RNA components. Immunofluorescent double labeling of transfected mammalian cells revealed that Stau is localized to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), implicating this RNA - binding protein in mRNA targeting to the RER, perhaps via a multistep process involving microtubules. These results are the first demonstration of the association of an RNA - binding protein in addition to ribosomal proteins, with the RER, implicating this class of proteins in the transport of RNA to its site of translation.
