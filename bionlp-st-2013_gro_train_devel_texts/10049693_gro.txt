The LIM proteins FHL1 and FHL3 are expressed differently in skeletal muscle. We have determined the complete mRNA sequence of FHL3 (formerly SLIM2). We have confirmed that it is a member of the family of LIM proteins that share a similar secondary protein structure, renamed as Four-and-a-Half-LIM domain (or FHL) proteins in accordance with this structure. The "half-LIM" domain is a single zinc finger domain that may represent a subfamily of LIM domains and defines this particular family of LIM proteins. The distribution of FHL mRNA expression within a variety of murine tissues is complex. Both FHL1 and FHL3 were expressed in a number of skeletal muscles while FHL2 was expressed at high levels in cardiac muscle. Localisation of FHL3 to human chromosome 1 placed this gene in the proximity of, but not overlapping with, alleles associated with muscle diseases. FHL1 and FHL3 mRNAs were reciprocally expressed in the murine C2C12 skeletal muscle cell line and this suggested that the pattern of expression was linked to key events in myogenesis.
