Genomic structure, chromosomal mapping, and expression pattern of human DCAMKL1 (KIAA0369), a homologue of DCX (XLIS). Human DCAMKL1, also known as KIAA0369, is a homologue of DCX (Xq22. 3), a gene associated with X-linked lissencephaly and subcortical band heterotopia. This suggests that DCAMKL1 may play a role in neuronal migration. The gene also shows similarity to Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. We have determined its genomic structure, regional mapping, and expression pattern in human tissues. DCAMKL1 consists of at least 18 exons ranging from 58 to 3359 bp in length. We have characterized the exon/intron borders, and primers were designed to amplify each individual exon for mutation analysis. DCAMKL1 was mapped to chromosome 13q13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Northern blot analysis showed DCAMKL1 to be predominantly expressed in human fetal brain as a major transcript of about 5.8 kb.
