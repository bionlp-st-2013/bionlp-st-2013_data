The homeobox gene GBX2, a target of the myb oncogene, mediates autocrine growth and monocyte differentiation. The homeobox gene GBX2 was identified as a target gene of the v - Myb oncoprotein encoded by the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV). GBX2 activation by c - Myb requires signal transduction emanating from the cell surface while the leukemogenic AMV v - Myb constitutively induces the GBX2 gene. Mutations in the DNA binding domain of AMV - Myb render it independent of signaling events and concomitantly abrogate the collaboration between Myb and CCAAT Enhancer Binding Proteins (C/EBP), which are involved in granulocyte differentiation. Ectopic expression of GBX2 in growth factor - dependent myeloblasts induces monocytic features and independence from exogenous cytokines, reflecting distinct features of AMV - transformed cells. Our results suggest that Myb or factors it interacts with contribute to hematopoietic lineage choice and differentiation in a signal transduction - dependent fashion.
