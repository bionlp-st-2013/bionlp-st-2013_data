Physical interaction of the bHLH LYL1 protein and NF - kappaB1 p105. The LYL1 gene was first identified upon the molecular characterization of the t(7;9)(q35;p13) translocation associated with some human T - cell acute leukemias (T - ALLs). In adult tissues, LYL1 expression is restricted to hematopoietic cells with the notable exclusion of the T cell lineage. LYL1 encodes a basic helix - loop - helix (bHLH) protein highly related to TAL - 1, whose activation is also associated with a high proportion of human T - ALLs. A yeast two - hybrid system was used to identify proteins that specifically interact with LYL1 and might mediate its activities. We found that p105, the precursor of NF - kappaB1 p50, was the major LYL1 - interacting protein in this system. The association between LYL1 and p105 was confirmed both in vitro and in vivo in mammalian cells. Biochemical studies indicated that the interaction was mediated by the bHLH motif of LYL1 and the ankyrin - like motifs of p105. Ectopic expression of LYL1 in a human T cell line caused a significant decrease in NF - kappaB - dependent transcription, associated with a reduced level of NF - kappaB1 proteins.
