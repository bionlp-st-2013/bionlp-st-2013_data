Mapping the functional domains of BRCA1. Interaction of the ring finger domains of BRCA1 and BARD1. Breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and BRCA1 - associated RING domain 1 (BARD1) are multidomain proteins that interact in vivo via their N - terminal RING finger motif regions. To characterize functional aspects of the BRCA1/BARD1 interaction, we have defined the structural domains required for the interaction, as well as their oligomerization state, relative stability, and possible nucleic acid binding activity. We have found that the RING finger motifs do not themselves constitute stable structural domains but are instead part of larger domains comprising residues 1 - 109 of BRCA1 and residues 26 - 119 of BARD1. These domains exist as homodimers and preferentially form a stable heterodimer. Shorter BRCA1 RING finger constructs do not interact with BARD1 or with longer BRCA1 constructs, indicating that the heterodimeric and homodimer interactions are mediated by regions outside the canonical RING finger motif. Nucleic acid binding is a generally proposed function of RING finger domains. We show that neither the homodimers nor the heterodimer displays affinity for nucleic acids, indicating that the proposed roles of BRCA1 and BARD1 in DNA repair and/or transcriptional activation must be mediated either by other regions of the proteins or by additional cofactors.
