Complete sequence of the human mucin MUC4: a putative cell membrane - associated mucin. The MUC4 gene, which encodes a human epithelial mucin, is expressed in various epithelial tissues, just as well in adult as in poorly differentiated cells in the embryo and fetus. Its N - terminus and central sequences have previously been reported as comprising a 27 - residue peptide signal, followed by a large domain varying in length from 3285 to 7285 amino acid residues. The present study establishes the whole coding sequence of MUC4 in which the C - terminus is 1156 amino acid residues long and shares a high degree of similarity with the rat sialomucin complex (SMC). SMC is a heterodimeric glycoprotein complex composed of mucin (ascites sialoglycoprotein 1, ASGP - 1) and transmembrane (ASGP - 2) subunits. The same organization is found in MUC4, where the presence of a GlyAspProHis proteolytic site may cleave the large precursor into two subunits, MUC4alpha and MUC4beta. Like ASGP - 2, which binds the receptor tyrosine kinase p185(neu), MUC4beta possesses two epidermal growth factor - like domains, a transmembrane sequence and a potential phosphorylated site. MUC4, the human homologue of rat SMC, may be a heterodimeric bifunctional cell - surface glycoprotein of 2.12 micrometers. These results confer a new biological role for MUC4 as a ligand for ErbB2 in cell signalling.
