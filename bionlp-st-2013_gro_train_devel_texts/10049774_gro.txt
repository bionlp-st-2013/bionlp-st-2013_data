Cloning of BRAK, a novel divergent CXC chemokine preferentially expressed in normal versus malignant cells. Chemokines are a family of related proteins that regulate leukocyte infiltration into inflamed tissue and play important roles in many disease processes. Chemokines are divided into two major groups, CC or CXC, based on their sequence around the amino terminal cysteines. We report the PCR cloning of a novel human chemokine termed BRAK for its initial isolation from breast and kidney cells. This novel chemokine is distantly related to other CXC chemokines (30% identity with MIP - 2alpha and beta) and shares several biological activities. BRAK is expressed ubiquitously and highly in normal tissue. However, it was expressed in only 2 of 18 cancer cell lines. BRAK is located on human chromosome 5q31.
