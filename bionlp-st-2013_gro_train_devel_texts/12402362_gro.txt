Solution structure of the DNA - binding domain of interleukin enhancer binding factor 1 (FOXK1a). Interleukin enhancer binding factor (ILF) binds to the interleukin - 2 (IL - 2) promoter and regulates IL - 2 gene expression. In this study, the 3D structure of the DNA - binding domain of ILF was determined by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. NMR structure analysis revealed that the DNA - binding domain of ILF is a new member of the winged helix/forkhead family, and that its wing 2 contains an extra alpha - helix. This is the first study to report the presence of a C - terminal alpha - helix in place of a typical wing 2 in a member of this family. This structural difference may be responsible for the different DNA - binding specificity of ILF compared to other winged helix/forkhead proteins. Our deletion studies of the fragments of ILF also suggest that the C - terminal region plays a regulatory role in DNA binding.
