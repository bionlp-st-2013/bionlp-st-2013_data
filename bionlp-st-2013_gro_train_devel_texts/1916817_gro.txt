Localization of the gene for the DNA-binding protein AP-2 to human chromosome 6p22.3-pter. A variety of cellular proteins bind to cellular and viral enhancer elements. One such factor, known as AP-2, is a 52-kDa transcription factor identified by its interaction with the SV40 and metallothionein enhancers. In addition, it has been found that AP-2 binds to the SV40 T-antigen. AP-2 activity is mediated by both the state of cellular differentiation and changes in signal transduction pathways, suggesting a potential role of AP-2 in the regulation of diverse cellular processes. As part of an effort to examine the chromosomal organization of cellular genes encoding transcription factors, we report the mapping of the gene encoding AP-2 to human chromosome 6p22.3-24 by analysis of somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization to chromosomes.
