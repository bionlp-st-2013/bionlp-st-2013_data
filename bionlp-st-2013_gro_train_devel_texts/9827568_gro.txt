Further complexity of the human SOX gene family revealed by the combined use of highly degenerate primers and nested PCR. SOX proteins contain a conserved HMG-related DNA-binding domain. They fulfill essential functions during the development of animals. Mutations in several SOX genes have been implicated in human diseases. We present here a new set of PCR primers designed to amplify a broad range of SOX HMG-box sequences. These primers facilitated the cloning of several new SOX HMG boxes from human genomic DNA, revealing unexpected complexity of the SOX gene family.
