Active transcriptional repression by the Rb - E2F complex mediates G1 arrest triggered by p16INK4a, TGFbeta, and contact inhibition. Rb inhibits progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. It associates with a number of cellular proteins; however, the nature of these interactions and their relative significance in cell cycle regulation are still unclear. We present evidence that Rb must normally interact with the E2F family of transcription factors to arrest cells in G1, and that this arrest results from active transcriptional repression by the Rb - E2F complex, not from inactivation of E2F. Thus, a major role of E2F in cell cycle regulation is assembly of this repressor complex. We demonstrate that active repression by Rb - E2F mediates the G1 arrest triggered by TGFbeta, p16INK4a, and contact inhibition.
