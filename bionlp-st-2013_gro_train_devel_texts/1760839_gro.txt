B cell lymphoma - associated chromosomal translocation involves candidate oncogene lyt - 10, homologous to NF - kappa B p50. A B cell lymphoma - associated chromosomal translocation, t(10;14)(q24;q32), juxtaposes the immunoglobulin C alpha 1 locus to a novel gene, lyt - 10. The normal lyt - 10 cDNA codes for a 98 kd protein which displays amino - terminal homology with the rel (DNA - binding) domain of the NF - kappa B - rel family of transcription factors and carboxy - terminal homology with the NF - kappa B p50 precursor protein, including the putative proteolytic cleavage domain (poly - G) and the ankyrin - like repeat domains. The lyt - 10 protein can bind to kappa B sequences in vitro, although with different specificity from NF - kappa B p50, and in vitro DNA - binding is activated by removal of the ankyrin domain. Chromosomal translocation generates an lyt - 10 - C alpha 1 fusion gene coding for a protein that retains the rel effector domain, lacks the ankyrin regulatory domain, and binds kappa B sequences in vitro, suggesting its constitutive activation in vivo. Analogous rearrangements of the lyt - 10 gene have been found in an additional three cases of lymphoid neoplasia. The lyt - 10 gene defines a new subfamily (rel/poly - G/ankyrin) of NF - kappa B - rel transcription factors with potential for oncogenic activation in human cancer.
