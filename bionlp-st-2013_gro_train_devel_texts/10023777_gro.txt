Interleukin - 18 binding protein: a novel modulator of the Th1 cytokine response. An interleukin - 18 binding protein (IL - 18BP) was purified from urine by chromatography on IL - 18 beads, sequenced, cloned, and expressed in COS7 cells. IL - 18BP abolished IL - 18 induction of interferon - gamma (IFNgamma), IL - 8, and activation of NF - kappaB in vitro. Administration of IL - 18BP to mice abrogated circulating IFNgamma following LPS. Thus, IL - 18BP functions as an inhibitor of the early Th1 cytokine response. IL - 18BP is constitutively expressed in the spleen, belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily, and has limited homology to the IL - 1 type II receptor. Its gene was localized on human chromosome 11q13, and no exon coding for a transmembrane domain was found in an 8.3 kb genomic sequence. Several Poxviruses encode putative proteins highly homologous to IL - 18BP, suggesting that viral products may attenuate IL - 18 and interfere with the cytotoxic T cell response.
