Identification of a new murine runt domain-containing gene, Cbfa3, and localization of the human homolog, CBFA3, to chromosome 1p35-pter. Core binding factor (CBF) is a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of two distinct subunits. The monomeric beta subunit is ubiquitously expressed, whereas expression of the three alpha subunits isolated previously seems to be restricted mainly to hematopoietic tissues. To isolate additional alpha genes, degenerate oligonucleotides derived from the runt domain--a region shared by all alpha genes--were used for screening cDNA libraries. A 228-bp fragment was isolated from a mouse thymus cDNA library, which showed 82 and 76% DNA sequence identity to the previously isolated murine alpha genes, Cbfa1 and Cbfa2. This novel alpha gene was named Cbfa3. The corresponding sequence from the human homolog CBFA3 was obtained by cosmid cloning and sequencing of the appropriate restriction fragment. The corresponding regions of mouse Cbfa3 and human CBFA3 show 91% nucleotide identity and 100% protein identity. In situ hybridization and physical mapping of somatic cell hybrids localized CBFA3 to chromosome 1p35-pter.
