BCL6 can repress transcription from the human immunodeficiency virus type I promoter/enhancer region. The gene BCL6 encodes a zinc finger protein with similarities to transcription factors. We previously reported that a number of viral genomes, including human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV - 1), contain sequences which are similar to the BCL6 DNA - binding consensus in their promoter regions. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the full - length BCL6 protein extracted from transfected COS cells and a bacterially expressed truncated protein containing the BCL6 zinc fingers can bind specifically to DNA from the U3 promoter/enhancer region of HIV - 1. Transient transfections were performed to analyze the effects of the BCL6 protein on luciferase expression driven by the HIV - 1 long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences. Full - length BCL6 significantly repressed luciferase activity compared with multiple controls. We conclude that the BCL6 protein can bind to the HIV - 1 promoter - enhancer region and contains a domain upstream of its zinc fingers that can repress transcription from the HIV - 1 LTR.
