Wnt-induced dephosphorylation of axin releases beta-catenin from the axin complex. 
The stabilization of beta-catenin is a key regulatory step during cell fate changes and transformations to tumor cells.
Several interacting proteins, including Axin, APC, and the protein kinase GSK-3beta are implicated in regulating beta-catenin phosphorylation and its subsequent degradation.
Wnt signaling stabilizes beta-catenin, but it was not clear whether and how Wnt signaling regulates the beta-catenin complex.
Here we show that Axin is dephosphorylated in response to Wnt signaling.
The dephosphorylated Axin binds beta-catenin less efficiently than the phosphorylated form.
Thus, Wnt signaling lowers Axin's affinity for beta-catenin, thereby disengaging beta-catenin from the degradation machinery.
