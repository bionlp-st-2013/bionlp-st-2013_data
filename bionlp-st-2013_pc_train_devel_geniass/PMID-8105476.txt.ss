The t-complex polypeptide 1 complex is a chaperonin for tubulin and actin in vivo. 
A role in folding newly translated cytoskeletal proteins in the cytosol of eukaryotes has been proposed for t-complex polypeptide 1 (TCP1).
In this study, we investigated tubulin and actin biogenesis in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.
When extracts of pulse-labeled cells were analyzed by anion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography, newly synthesized alpha-tubulin, beta-tubulin, and actin were observed to enter a large molecular mass complex (approximately 900 kDa).
These proteins were released from this complex capable, in the case of tubulin, of forming heterodimers.
The large molecular mass complexes coeluted with TCP1 and could be immunoprecipitated by using an anti-TCP1 antibody.
These findings demonstrate that there is a cytosolic pathway for folding tubulin and actin in vivo that involves the TCP1 complex.
