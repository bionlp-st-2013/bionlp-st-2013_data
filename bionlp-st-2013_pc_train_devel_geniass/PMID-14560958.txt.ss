mTOR signaling to translation. 
Over the past few years, the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway has been implicated in the control of translation, both in yeast and in higher eukaryotes.
In this review, we provide an overview of translation in eukaryotes, and discuss the mechanisms and advantages of the regulation of translation.
We then describe how the TOR pathway can modulate translation in yeast and in mammals, through the modulation of the phosphorylation of key translation components, and the regulation of the abundance of ribosomes and translation factors.
