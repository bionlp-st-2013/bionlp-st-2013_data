p27 phosphorylation by Src regulates inhibition of cyclin E-Cdk2 .
The kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 regulates the G1 cell cycle phase .
Here , we present data indicating that the oncogenic kinase Src regulates p27 stability through phosphorylation of p27 at tyrosine 74 and tyrosine 88 .
Src inhibitors increase cellular p27 stability , and Src overexpression accelerates p27 proteolysis .
Src-phosphorylated p27 is shown to inhibit cyclin E-Cdk2 poorly in vitro , and Src transfection reduces p27-cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes .
Our data indicate that phosphorylation by Src impairs the Cdk2 inhibitory action of p27 and reduces its steady-state binding to cyclin E-Cdk2 to facilitate cyclin E-Cdk2-dependent p27 proteolysis .
Furthermore , we find that Src-activated breast cancer lines show reduced p27 and observe a correlation between Src activation and reduced nuclear p27 in 482 primary human breast cancers .
Importantly , we report that in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines , Src inhibition can increase p27 levels and restore tamoxifen sensitivity .
These data provide a new rationale for Src inhibitors in cancer therapy .
