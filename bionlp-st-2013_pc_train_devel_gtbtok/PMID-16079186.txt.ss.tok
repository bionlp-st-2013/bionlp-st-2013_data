mTOR function in skeletal muscle hypertrophy : increased ribosomal RNA via cell cycle regulators .
The purpose of this study was to identify the potential downstream functions associated with mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) signaling during myotube hypertrophy .
Terminally differentiated myotubes were serum stimulated for 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , and 48 h .
This treatment resulted in significant myotube hypertrophy ( protein/DNA ) and increased RNA content ( RNA/DNA ) with no changes in DNA content or indices of cell proliferation .
During myotube hypertrophy , the increase in RNA content was accompanied by an increase in tumor suppressor protein retinoblastoma ( Rb ) phosphorylation and a corresponding increase in the availability of the ribosomal DNA transcription factor upstream binding factor ( UBF ) .
Serum stimulation also induced an increase in cyclin D1 protein expression in the differentiated myotubes with a concomitant increase in cyclin D1-dependent cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) -4 activity toward Rb .
The increases in myotube hypertrophy and RNA content were blocked by rapamycin treatment , which also prevented the increase in cyclin D1 protein expression , CDK-4 activity , Rb phosphorylation , and the increase in UBF availability .
Our findings demonstrate that activation of mTOR is necessary for myotube hypertrophy and suggest that the role of mTOR is in part to modulate cyclin D1-dependent CDK-4 activity in the regulation of Rb and ribosomal RNA synthesis .
On the basis of these results , we propose that common molecular mechanisms contribute to the regulation of myotube hypertrophy and growth during the G1 phase of the cell cycle .
