Phosphatidic acid-mediated mitogenic activation of mTOR signaling .
The mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) governs cell growth and proliferation by mediating the mitogen- and nutrient-dependent signal transduction that regulates messenger RNA translation .
We identified phosphatidic acid ( PA ) as a critical component of mTOR signaling .
In our study , mitogenic stimulation of mammalian cells led to a phospholipase D-dependent accumulation of cellular PA , which was required for activation of mTOR downstream effectors .
PA directly interacted with the domain in mTOR that is targeted by rapamycin , and this interaction was positively correlated with mTOR 's ability to activate downstream effectors .
The involvement of PA in mTOR signaling reveals an important function of this lipid in signal transduction and protein synthesis , as well as a direct link between mTOR and mitogens .
Furthermore , these studies suggest a potential mechanism for the in vivo actions of the immunosuppressant rapamycin .
