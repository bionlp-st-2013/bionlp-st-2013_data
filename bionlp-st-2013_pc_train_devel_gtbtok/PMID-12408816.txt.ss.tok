Two TOR complexes , only one of which is rapamycin sensitive , have distinct roles in cell growth control .
The target of rapamycin ( TOR ) proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , TOR1 and TOR2 , redundantly regulate growth in a rapamycin-sensitive manner .
TOR2 additionally regulates polarization of the actin cytoskeleton in a rapamycin-insensitive manner .
We describe two functionally distinct TOR complexes .
TOR Complex 1 ( TORC1 ) contains TOR1 or TOR2 , KOG1 ( YHR186c ) , and LST8 .
TORC2 contains TOR2 , AVO1 ( YOL078w ) , AVO2 ( YMR068w ) , AVO3 ( YER093c ) , and LST8 .
FKBP-rapamycin binds TORC1 , and TORC1 disruption mimics rapamycin treatment , suggesting that TORC1 mediates the rapamycin-sensitive , TOR-shared pathway .
FKBP-rapamycin fails to bind TORC2 , and TORC2 disruption causes an actin defect , suggesting that TORC2 mediates the rapamycin-insensitive , TOR2-unique pathway .
Thus , the distinct TOR complexes account for the diversity , specificity , and selective rapamycin inhibition of TOR signaling .
TORC1 and possibly TORC2 are conserved from yeast to man .
