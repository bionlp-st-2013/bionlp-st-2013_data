Aberrant beta-catenin signaling in tuberous sclerosis .
The pathology associated with tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) shows diverse phenotypes that suggest abnormal signaling of multiple pathways .
Besides the negative regulatory role of the TSC1/TSC2 proteins on mTOR , we have reported an effect on beta-catenin signaling at the level of the degradation complex in vitro .
The TSC1/TSC2 complex associates with GSK3 and Axin and promotes beta-catenin degradation to inhibit Wnt-stimulated TCF/LEF-dependent transcription .
Here , we show that beta-catenin and its effectors , cyclin D1 and connexin 43 , were up-regulated in TSC-related angiomyolipomas and lymphangioleiomyomatosis .
This was supported by the failure of three disease-causing TSC2 missense mutants to inhibit Wnt signaling .
Further , the interaction between TSC1/TSC2 and components of the beta-catenin degradation complex was dependent on Wnt stimulation such that binding of tuberin to GSK3 and Axin was reduced in the presence of Wnt whereas the tuberin-Dishevelled interaction was increased .
GSK3 activity played a role in regulating the assembly/stability of the degradation complex .
Inhibition of GSK3 by lithium chloride reduced its association with TSC1 whereas disruption of GSK3-phosphorylation sites in TSC1 reduced interaction between TSC2 and TSC1 .
Collectively , our data provide further evidence that beta-catenin signaling plays a role in TSC pathogenesis in vivo and suggest a novel role of GSK3 in modulating the TSC1/TSC2 complex through TSC1 phosphorylation .
