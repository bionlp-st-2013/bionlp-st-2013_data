The FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein ( FRAP ) is a CLIP-170 kinase .
CLIP-170/Restin belongs to a family of conserved microtubule ( MT ) -associated proteins , which are important for MT organization and functions .
CLIP-170 is a phosphoprotein and phosphorylation is thought to regulate the binding of CLIP-170 to MTs .
However , little is known about the kinase(s) involved .
In this study , we show that FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein ( FRAP , also called mTOR/RAFT ) interacts with CLIP-170 .
CLIP-170 is phosphorylated in vivo at multiple sites , including rapamycin-sensitive and -insensitive sites , and is phosphorylated by FRAP in vitro at the rapamycin-sensitive sites .
In addition , rapamycin inhibited the ability of CLIP-170 to bind to MTs .
Our observations suggest that multiple CLIP-170 kinases are involved in positive and negative control of CLIP-170 , and FRAP is a CLIP-170 kinase positively regulating the MT-binding behavior of CLIP-170 .
