Three distinct anti-allergic drugs , amlexanox , cromolyn and tranilast , bind to S100A12 and S100A13 of the S100 protein family .
To investigate the roles of calcium-binding proteins in degranulation , we used three anti-allergic drugs , amlexanox , cromolyn and tranilast , which inhibit IgE-mediated degranulation of mast cells , as molecular probes in affinity chromatography .
All of these drugs , which have different structures but similar function , scarcely bound to calmodulin in bovine lung extract , but bound to the same kinds of calcium-binding proteins , such as the 10-kDa proteins isolated in this study , calcyphosine and annexins I-V .
The 10-kDa proteins obtained on three drug-coupled resins and on phenyl-Sepharose were analysed by reversed-phase HPLC .
It was found that two characteristic 10-kDa proteins , one polar and one less polar , were bound with all three drugs , although S100A2 ( S100L ) , of the S100 family , was bound with phenyl-Sepharose .
The cDNA and deduced amino acid sequence proved our major polar protein to be identical with the calcium-binding protein in bovine amniotic fluid ( CAAF1 , S100A12 ) .
The cDNA and deduced amino acid sequence of the less-polar protein shared 95 % homology with human and mouse S100A13 .
In addition , it was demonstrated that the native S100A12 and recombinant S100A12 and S100A13 bind to immobilized amlexanox .
On the basis of these findings , we speculate that the three anti-allergic drugs might inhibit degranulation by binding with S100A12 and S100A13 .
