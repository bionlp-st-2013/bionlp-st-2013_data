E2F-6 , a member of the E2F family that can behave as a transcriptional repressor .
The E2F family of proteins is required to establish the correct cell-cycle-dependent transcription of genes that direct the process of cell division .
All previously identified E2F proteins can act in a similar manner ; depending on whether or not they are associated with the cell cycle inhibitors the retinoblastoma protein ( pRB ) , p107 , or p130 , they can either repress or activate the transcription of E2F-responsive genes .
We now report the cloning and characterization of another E2F family member , E2F-6 , whose structure is reminiscent of the dominant inhibitors of other transcription factor families .
The dimerization and DNA binding properties of E2F-6 are similar to those of the other E2F family members .
However , it is not regulated by pRB , p107 , or p130 , and it is unable to activate transcription .
Instead , it can act to repress the transcription of E2F responsive genes by countering the activity of the other E2F complexes via a pRB- , p107- , or p130-independent mechanism .
