Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel angiopoietin family protein , angiopoietin-3 .
Using homology-based PCR , we have isolated cDNA encoding a novel member ( 491 amino acids ) of the angiopoietin ( Ang ) family from human adult heart cDNA and have designated it angiopoietin-3 ( Ang3 ) .
The NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal portions of Ang-3 contain the characteristic coiled-coil domain and fibrinogen-like domain that are conserved in other known Angs .
Ang3 has a highly hydrophobic region at the N-terminus ( approximately 21 amino acids ) that is typical of a signal sequence for protein secretion .
Ang3 mRNA is most abundant in adrenal gland , placenta , thyroid gland , heart and small intestine in human adult tissues .
Additionally , Ang3 is a secretory protein , but is not a mitogen in endothelial cells .
