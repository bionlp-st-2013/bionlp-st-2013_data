TIF1gamma , a novel member of the transcriptional intermediary factor 1 family .
We report the cloning and characterization of a novel member of the Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 1 ( TIF1 ) gene family , human TIF1gamma .
Similar to TIF1alpha and TIF1beta , the structure of TIF1beta is characterized by multiple domains : RING finger , B boxes , Coiled coil , PHD/TTC , and bromodomain .
Although structurally related to TIF1alpha and TIF1beta , TIF1gamma presents several functional differences .
In contrast to TIF1alpha , but like TIF1beta , TIF1 does not interact with nuclear receptors in yeast two-hybrid or GST pull-down assays and does not interfere with retinoic acid response in transfected mammalian cells .
Whereas TIF1alpha and TIF1beta were previously found to interact with the KRAB silencing domain of KOX1 and with the HP1alpha , MODI ( HP1beta ) and MOD2 ( HP1gamma ) heterochromatinic proteins , suggesting that they may participate in a complex involved in heterochromatin-induced gene repression , TIF1gamma does not interact with either the KRAB domain of KOX1 or the HP1 proteins .
Nevertheless , TIF1gamma , like TIF1alpha and TIF1beta , exhibits a strong silencing activity when tethered to a promoter .
Since deletion of a novel motif unique to the three TIF1 proteins , called TIF1 signature sequence ( TSS ) , abrogates transcriptional repression by TIF1gamma , this motif likely participates in TIF1 dependent repression .
