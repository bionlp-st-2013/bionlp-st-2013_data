Molecular characterization of a third member of the guanylyl cyclase-activating protein subfamily .
The mammalian retina contains at least two guanylyl cyclases ( GC1 and GC2 ) and two guanylyl cyclase-activating proteins ( GCAP1 and GCAP2 ) .
Here we present evidence of the presence of a new photoreceptor-specific GCAP , termed GCAP3 , which is closely related to GCAP1 .
The sequence similarity of GCAP3 with GCAP1 and GCAP2 is 57 and 49 % , respectively .
Recombinant GCAP3 and GCAP2 stimulate GC1 and GC2 in low [Ca2+]free and inhibit GCs when [Ca2+]free is elevated , unlike GCAP1 , which only stimulates GC1 .
GCAP3 is encoded by a distinct gene present in other mammalian species but could not be detected by genomic Southern blotting in rodents , amphibians , and lower vertebrates .
The intron/exon arrangement of the GCAP3 gene is identical to that of the other GCAP genes .
While the GCAP1 and GCAP2 genes are arranged in a tail-to-tail array on chromosome 6p in human , the GCAP3 gene is located on 3q13.1 , suggesting an ancestral gene duplication/translocation event .
The identification of multiple Ca2+-binding proteins that interact with GC is suggestive of complex regulatory mechanisms for photoreceptor GC .
