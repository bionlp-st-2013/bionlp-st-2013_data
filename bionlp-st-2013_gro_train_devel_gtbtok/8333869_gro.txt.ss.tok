Smaller isoform of human mitochondrial transcription factor 1 : its wide distribution and production by alternative splicing .
Mitochondrial transcriptional factor 1 ( mtTF1 ) is required for both transcription and replication of mammalian mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) and it has two consensus sequences of HMG ( high mobility group ) boxes .
In studies on the regulation of gene expression of mtTF1 , we examined the steady state level of the mRNA in cultured HeLa cells .
We found that in addition to the major mRNA , 30 % of the mRNA of mtTF1 in the cells was a smaller isoform with a 96 base deletion .
This smaller mRNA was also found in most human tissues .
The region of the deletion corresponds to the second HMG-box , which may interact directly with DNA .
We examined the structure of the genomic gene encoding the human mtTF1 to determine the mechanism of the deletion .
We found that the gene is composed of 7 exons spanning over 10 kilobase-pairs and that its 5th exon is identical to the 96 bases skipped in the shorter mRNA .
Therefore , the shorter mtTF1 is concluded to be generated by alternative splicing .
