The BCL6 proto-oncogene suppresses p53 expression in germinal-centre B cells .
The human proto-oncogene BCL6 encodes a BTB/POZ-zinc-finger transcriptional repressor that is necessary for germinal-centre formation and is implicated in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphoma .
The precise function of BCL6 in germinal-centre development and lymphomagenesis is unclear because very few direct BCL6 target genes have been identified .
Here we report that BCL6 suppresses the expression of the p53 ( also known as tp53 ) tumour suppressor gene and modulates DNA damage-induced apoptotic responses in germinal-centre B cells .
BCL6 represses p53 transcription by binding two specific DNA sites within the p53 promoter region and , accordingly , p53 expression is absent in germinal-centre B cells where BCL6 is highly expressed .
Suppression of BCL6 expression via specific short interfering RNA leads to increased levels of p53 messenger RNA and protein both under basal conditions and in response to DNA damage .
Most notably , constitutive expression of BCL6 protects B cell lines from apoptosis induced by DNA damage .
These results suggest that an important function of BCL6 is to allow germinal-centre B cells to tolerate the physiological DNA breaks required for immunoglobulin class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation without inducing a p53-dependent apoptotic response .
These findings also imply that deregulated BCL6 expression contributes to lymphomagenesis in part by functional inactivation of p53 .
