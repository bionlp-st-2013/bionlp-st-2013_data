A SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodeling complex , E-RC1 , is required for tissue-specific transcriptional regulation by EKLF in vitro .
Erythroid Krueppel-like factor ( EKLF ) is necessary for stage-specific expression of the human beta-globin gene .
We show that EKLF requires a SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodeling complex , EKLF coactivator-remodeling complex 1 ( E-RC1 ) , to generate a DNase I hypersensitive , transcriptionally active beta-globin promoter on chromatin templates in vitro .
E-RC1 contains BRG1 , BAF170 , BAF155 , and INI1 ( BAF47 ) homologs of yeast SWI/SNF subunits , as well as a subunit unique to higher eukaryotes , BAF57 , which is critical for chromatin remodeling and transcription with EKLF .
E-RC1 displays functional selectivity toward transcription factors , since it can not activate expression of chromatin-assembled HIV-1 templates with the E box-binding protein TFE-3 .
Thus , a member of the SWI/SNF family acts directly in transcriptional activation and may regulate subsets of genes by selectively interacting with specific DNA-binding proteins .
