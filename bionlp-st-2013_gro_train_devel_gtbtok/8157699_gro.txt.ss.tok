Characterization of the genomic structure , chromosomal location , promoter , and development expression of the alpha-globin transcription factor CP2 .
We recently cloned murine and human cDNAs that encode CP2 , a cellular transcription factor that interacts with the alpha-globin promoter as well as with additional cellular and viral promoter elements .
We have now characterized the genomic structure , chromosome location , promoter , and expression pattern of the factor .
Genes for the murine and human mRNAs contained 16 and 15 exons , respectively .
Both genes spanned approximately 30 kilobases of chromosomal DNA , and among coding exons , all exon/intron boundaries were conserved .
The human gene for CP2 was found to reside on chromosome 12 while the murine gene mapped to the distal end of chromosome 15 , near Gdc-1 , Wnt-1 , and Rarg , a region syntenic with human chromosome 12 .
The murine and human promoters initiated mRNAs at multiple start sites in a conserved region that spanned more than 450 nucleotides .
Lastly , a study of the pattern of CP2 gene expression showed that the factor was expressed in all adult and fetal murine tissues examined from at least day 9.5 of development .
