Characterization of NERF , a novel transcription factor related to the Ets factor ELF-1 .
We have cloned the gene for a novel Ets-related transcription factor , new Ets-related factor ( NERF ) , from human spleen , fetal liver , and brain .
Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of NERF with those of other members of the Ets family reveals that the level of homology to ELF-1 , which is involved in the regulation of several T- and B-cell-specific genes , is highest .
Homologies are clustered in the putative DNA binding domain in the middle of the protein , a basic domain just upstream of this domain , and several shorter stretches of homology towards the amino terminus .
The presence of two predominant NERF transcripts in various fetal and adult human tissues is due to at least three alternative splice products , NERF-1a , NERF-1b , and NERF-2 , which differ in their amino termini and their expression in different tissues .
Only NERF-2 and ELF-1 , and not NERF-1a and NERF-1b , function as transcriptional activators of the lyn and blk gene promoters , although all isoforms of NERF bind with affinities similar to those of ELF-1 to a variety of Ets binding sites in , among others , the blk , lck , lyn , mb-1 , and immunoglobulin H genes and are expressed at similar levels .
Since NERF and ELF-1 are coexpressed in B and T cells , both might be involved in the regulation of the same genes .
