Chromosomal localization of three human genes encoding bone morphogenetic protein receptors .
Bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) are members of the TGF-beta superfamily that play a pivotal role in bone formation during embryogenesis and fracture repair .
BMP signaling occurs via hetero-oligomeric serine/threonine kinase complexes of BMP type I ( BMPR-IA or BMPR-IB ) and type II receptors ( BMPR-II ) .
BMPR-IA and IB are closely related receptors , with sequence differences conserved between different species , suggesting that they serve distinct functions .
Here we report the cDNA cloning of human BMPR1B and the chromosomal localization of all three BMPR genes .
Using somatic cell hybrid and FISH analyses , the BMPR1A , BMPR1B , and BMPR2 genes were assigned to 10q23 , 4q22-24 , and 2q33-34 , respectively .
A processed BMPR1A pseudogene was mapped to 6q23 .
