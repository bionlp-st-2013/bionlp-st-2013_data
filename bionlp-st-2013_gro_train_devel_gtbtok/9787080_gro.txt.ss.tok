Characterization of a human homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor spt3 ( SUPT3H ) .
Spt3 is a Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor that is required in vivo for the transcription of a number of RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes .
We report the cloning of the gene encoding the human homologue of Spt3 , SUPT3H , and its initial functional analysis .
The human and yeast Spt3 homologues share an overall identity of 30 % that defines three conserved regions , suggesting possible functional domains .
To determine whether SUPT3H is a true functional Spt3 homologue , we tested for complementation of an spt3Delta mutation in yeast .
While expression of the full-length SUPT3H is unable to complement an spt3Delta mutation , expression of a human-yeast chimeric gene that contains 42 % human sequences can partially complement an spt3Delta mutation .
These data suggest that the transcriptional control carried out by Spt3 has been conserved from yeast to human .
