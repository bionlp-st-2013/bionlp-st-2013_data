Rpp14 and Rpp29 , two protein subunits of human ribonuclease P .
In HeLa cells , the tRNA processing enzyme ribonuclease P ( RNase P ) consists of an RNA molecule associated with at least eight protein subunits , hPop1 , Rpp14 , Rpp20 , Rpp25 , Rpp29 , Rpp30 , Rpp38 , and Rpp40 .
Five of these proteins ( hPop1p , Rpp20 , Rpp30 , Rpp38 , and Rpp40 ) have been partially characterized .
Here we report on the cDNA cloning and immunobiochemical analysis of Rpp14 and Rpp29 .
Polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against recombinant Rpp14 and Rpp29 recognize their corresponding antigens in HeLa cells and precipitate catalytically active RNase P. Rpp29 shows 23 % identity with Pop4p , a subunit of yeast nuclear RNase P and the ribosomal RNA processing enzyme RNase MRP .
Rpp14 , by contrast , exhibits no significant homology to any known yeast gene .
Thus , human RNase P differs in the details of its protein composition , and perhaps in the functions of some of these proteins , from the yeast enzyme .
