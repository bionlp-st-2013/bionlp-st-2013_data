PML regulates p53 stability by sequestering Mdm2 to the nucleolus .
The promyelocytic leukaemia ( PML ) tumour-suppressor protein potentiates p53 function by regulating post-translational modifications , such as CBP-dependent acetylation and Chk2-dependent phosphorylation , in the PML-Nuclear Body ( NB ) .
PML was recently shown to interact with the p53 ubiquitin-ligase Mdm2 ( refs 4-6 ) ; however , the mechanism by which PML regulates Mdm2 remains unclear .
Here , we show that PML enhances p53 stability by sequestering Mdm2 to the nucleolus .
We found that after DNA damage , PML and Mdm2 accumulate in the nucleolus in an Arf-independent manner .
In addition , we found that the nucleolar localization of PML is dependent on ATR activation and phosphorylation of PML by ATR .
Notably , in Pml(-/-) cells , sequestration of Mdm2 to the nucleolus was impaired , as well as p53 stabilization and the induction of apoptosis .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that PML physically associates with the nucleolar protein L11 , and that L11 knockdown impairs the ability of PML to localize to nucleoli after DNA damage .
These findings demonstrate an unexpected role of PML in the nucleolar network for tumour suppression .
