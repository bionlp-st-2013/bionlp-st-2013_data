Identification of a novel isoform of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor that is enriched in retinal pigment epithelium .
Mutations at the mouse locus encoding microphthalmia-associated transcription factor ( Mitf ) affect the development of many cell types , including retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) , melanocytes , mast cells , and osteoclasts .
Here we have identified a novel Mitf isoform , Mitf-a , and its human homologue MITF-A by cDNA cloning .
MITF-A consists of 520 amino acid residues and differs in the amino-terminus from authentic melanocyte-type MITF ( MITF-M ) .
MITF-A mRNA is widely expressed and represents a predominant MITF isoform in cultured RPE cells , whereas MITF-M mRNA is exclusively expressed in melanocytes and melanoma cells .
In situ hybridization analysis suggested that Mitf-a mRNA is enriched in the prospective RPE of mouse embryo .
Moreover , transient cotransfection assays suggested that MITF-A activated transcription of the tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein 1 genes .
MITF-A/Mitf-a therefore may play an important role in melanogenesis in RPE .
