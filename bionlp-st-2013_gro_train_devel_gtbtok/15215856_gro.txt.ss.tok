A membrane protein complex mediates retro-translocation from the ER lumen into the cytosol .
Elimination of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) by retro-translocation is an important physiological adaptation to ER stress .
This process requires recognition of a substrate in the ER lumen and its subsequent movement through the membrane by the cytosolic p97 ATPase .
Here we identify a p97-interacting membrane protein complex in the mammalian ER that links these two events .
The central component of the complex , Derlin-1 , is a homologue of Der1 , a yeast protein whose inactivation prevents the elimination of misfolded luminal ER proteins .
Derlin-1 associates with different substrates as they move through the membrane , and inactivation of Derlin-1 in C. elegans causes ER stress .
Derlin-1 interacts with US11 , a virally encoded ER protein that specifically targets MHC class I heavy chains for export from the ER , as well as with VIMP , a novel membrane protein that recruits the p97 ATPase and its cofactor .
