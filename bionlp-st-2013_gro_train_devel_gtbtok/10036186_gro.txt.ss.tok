A gene upregulated in the acoustically damaged chick basilar papilla encodes a novel WD40 repeat protein .
The chick WDR1 gene is expressed at higher levels in the chick basilar papilla after acoustic overstimulation .
The 3.3-kb WDR1 cDNA encodes a novel 67-kDa protein containing nine WD40 repeats , motifs that mediate protein-protein interactions .
The predicted WDR1 protein has high sequence identity to WD40-repeat proteins in budding yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) , two slime molds ( Dictyostelium discoideum and Physarum polycephalum ) , and the roundworm ( Caenorhabditis elegans ) .
The yeast and P. polycephalum proteins bind actin , suggesting that the novel chick protein may be an actin-binding protein .
Sequence database comparisons identified mouse and human cDNAs with high sequence identity to the chick WDR1 cDNA .
The mouse Wdr1 and human WDR1 proteins showed 95 % sequence identity to each other and 86 % identity to the chick WDR1 protein .
Northern blot analysis of total RNA from the chick basilar papilla after noise trauma revealed increased levels of a 3.1-kb transcript in the lesioned area .
The WDR1 gene was mapped to human chromosome 4 , between 22 and 24 cM from the telomere of 4p .
