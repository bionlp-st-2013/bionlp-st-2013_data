Ski is a component of the histone deacetylase complex required for transcriptional repression by Mad and thyroid hormone receptor .
The N-CoR/SMRT complex containing mSin3 and histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) mediates transcriptional repression by nuclear hormone receptors and Mad .
The proteins encoded by the ski proto-oncogene family directly bind to N-CoR/SMRT and mSin3A , and forms a complex with HDAC. c-Ski and its related gene product Sno are required for transcriptional repression by Mad and thyroid hormone receptor ( TRbeta ) .
The oncogenic form , v-Ski , which lacks the mSin3A-binding domain , acts in a dominant-negative fashion , and abrogates transcriptional repression by Mad and TRbeta .
In ski-deficient mouse embryos , the ornithine decarboxylase gene , whose expression is normally repressed by Mad-Max , is expressed ectopically .
These results show that Ski is a component of the HDAC complex and that Ski is required for the transcriptional repression mediated by this complex .
The involvement of c-Ski in the HDAC complex indicates that the function of the HDAC complex is important for oncogenesis .
