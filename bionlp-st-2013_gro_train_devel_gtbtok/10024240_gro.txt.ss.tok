A molecular pathway revealing a genetic basis for human cardiac and craniofacial defects .
Microdeletions of chromosome 22q11 are the most common genetic defects associated with cardiac and craniofacial anomalies in humans .
A screen for mouse genes dependent on dHAND , a transcription factor implicated in neural crest development , identified Ufd1 , which maps to human 22q11 and encodes a protein involved in degradation of ubiquitinated proteins .
Mouse Ufd1 was specifically expressed in most tissues affected in patients with 22q11 deletion syndrome .
The human UFD1L gene was deleted in all 182 patients studied with 22q11 deletion , and a smaller deletion of approximately 20 kilobases that removed exons 1 to 3 of UFD1L was found in one individual with features typical of 22q11 deletion syndrome .
These data suggest that UFD1L haploinsufficiency contributes to the congenital heart and craniofacial defects seen in 22q11 deletion .
