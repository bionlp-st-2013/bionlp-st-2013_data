p105, the NF-kappa B p50 precursor protein, is one of the cellular proteins complexed with the v-Rel oncoprotein in transformed chicken spleen cells. 
Active NF-kappa B-like transcription complexes are multimers consisting of one or two members of a family of proteins related to the c-Rel proto-oncoprotein. We have isolated a chicken cDNA encoding p105, the precursor protein for the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B. Sequence analysis shows that chicken p105 is approximately 70% identical to the mouse and human p105 proteins, containing the Rel homology domain in its N-terminal 370 amino acids and several ankyrinlike repeats in the C-terminal portion of the protein. The Rel homology domain is particularly highly conserved between chicken and mammalian p50, and an in vitro-synthesized, truncated chicken p105 protein, containing sequences that correspond to the predicted p50 protein, bound to a consensus kappa B site in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In v-Rel-transformed chicken spleen cells, v-Rel is found in high-molecular-weight complexes which include cellular proteins of approximately 124 kDa (p124) and 115 kDa (p115). Here we report that in vitro-produced p105 comigrates with p124 from v-Rel-transformed spleen cells and that p105 and p124 appear to be identical by partial proteolytic mapping with V8 protease. Furthermore, both p105 and p50 can complex directly with v-Rel and chicken c-Rel in vitro. However, in vitro association with p105 by v-Rel does not necessarily correlate with transformation, since one nontransforming v-Rel mutant can associate with p105 in vitro.
