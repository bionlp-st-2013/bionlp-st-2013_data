MDM2 mRNA expression in the p53 pathway may predict the potential of invasion and liver metastasis in colorectal cancer. 
PURPOSE: The p53/MDM2/p14ARF pathway is one of the major signaling cascades involved in the regulation of apoptosis. Although many tumors have been reported to show disruption of the p53/MDM2/p14ARF pathway, few studies have examined p53, MDM2, and p14ARF simultaneously in colorectal carcinoma. The present study was undertaken to clarify whether correlations exist among MDM2, p53, and p14ARF in colorectal cancer. METHODS: We determined the presence of mutations in the p53 gene, MDM2 expression, and methylation status of the p14ARF in 97 primary colorectal carcinoma specimens. Associations with survival and clinicopathologic factors were investigated. RESULTS: At least one abnormality of these three molecules was found in 82 (84 percent) tumors. We observed a significant inverse association between MDM2 expression and tumor invasion (P = 0.01). Furthermore, the presence of liver metastasis was also significantly associated with low MDM2 expression (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that disruption of the p53/MDM2/p14ARF pathway may frequently participate in colonic carcinogenesis and that MDM2 expression status may be a factor in the prediction of potential invasion and liver metastasis of colorectal carcinomas.
