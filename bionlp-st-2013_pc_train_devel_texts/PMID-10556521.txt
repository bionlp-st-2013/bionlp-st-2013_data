Cloning and functional characterization of the human sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters hSVCT1 and hSVCT2. 
Two sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters, hSVCT1 and hSVCT2, were cloned from a human kidney cDNA library. hSVCT1 had a 1797 bp open reading frame encoding a 598 amino acid polypeptide. The 1953 bp open reading frame of hSVCT2 encoded a 650 amino acid polypeptide. Using a Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system, both transporters were functionally expressed. By Eadie-Hofstee transformation the apparent K(m) of hSVCT1 for ascorbate was 252.0 microM and of hSVCT2 for ascorbate was 21.3 microM. Both transporters were sodium-dependent and did not transport dehydroascorbic acid. Incubation of oocytes expressing either transporter with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) inhibited ascorbate transport activity. Availability of the human transporter clones may facilitate new strategies for determining vitamin C intake.
