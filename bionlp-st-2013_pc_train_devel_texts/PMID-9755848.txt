Rat liver mitochondria can hydrolyse thiamine pyrophosphate to thiamine monophosphate which can cross the mitochondrial membrane in a carrier-mediated process. 
We show here that TPP --> TMP conversion can take place in rat liver mitochondria. This occurs via the novel, putative TPP pyrophosphatase localised in the mitochondrial matrix, as shown both by digitonin titration and by an HPLC enzyme assay carried out on the mitochondrial matrix fraction. Certain features of the reaction, including the substrate and pH dependence, are reported. Additional evidence is given that externally added TMP can cross the mitochondrial membrane in a manner consistent with the occurrence of a carrier-mediated process. This can occur both via the TPP translocator and via a novel translocator, inhibited by CAT but different from the ADP/ATP carrier.
