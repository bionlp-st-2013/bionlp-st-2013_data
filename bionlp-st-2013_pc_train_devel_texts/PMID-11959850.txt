Kinetic mechanism of activation of the Cdk2/cyclin A complex. Key role of the C-lobe of the Cdk. 
Eukaryotic cell cycle progression is controlled by the ordered action of cyclin-dependent kinases, activation of which occurs through the binding of the cyclin to the Cdk followed by phosphorylation of a conserved threonine in the T-loop of the Cdk by Cdk-activating kinase (CAK). Despite our understanding of the structural changes, which occur upon Cdk/cyclin formation and activation, little is known about the dynamics of the molecular events involved. We have characterized the mechanism of Cdk2/cyclin A complex formation and activation at the molecular and dynamic level by rapid kinetics and demonstrate here that it is a two-step process. The first step involves the rapid association between the PSTAIRE helix of Cdk2 and helices 3 and 5 of the cyclin to yield an intermediate complex in which the threonine in the T-loop is not accessible for phosphorylation. Additional contacts between the C-lobe of the Cdk and the N-terminal helix of the cyclin then induce the isomerization of the Cdk into a fully mature form by promoting the exposure of the T-loop for phosphorylation by CAK and the formation of the substrate binding site. This conformational change is selective for the cyclin partner.
