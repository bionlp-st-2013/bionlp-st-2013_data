Phosphorylation of p50 NF-kappaB at a single serine residue by DNA-dependent protein kinase is critical for VCAM-1 expression upon TNF treatment. 
The DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB is critical for VCAM-1 expression during inflammation. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is thought to be involved in NF-kappaB activation. Here we show that DNA-PK is required for VCAM-1 expression in response to TNF. The phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of I-kappaBalpha as well as the serine 536 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65 NF-kappaB were insufficient for VCAM-1 expression in response to TNF. The requirement for p50 NF-kappaB in TNF-induced VCAM-1 expression may be associated with its interaction with and phosphorylation by DNA-PK, which appears to be dominant over the requirement for p65 NF-kappaB activation. p50 NF-kappaB binding to its consensus sequence increased its susceptibility to phosphorylation by DNA-PK. Additionally, DNA-PK activity appeared to increase the association between p50/p50 and p50/p65 NF-kappaB dimers upon binding to DNA and after binding of p50 NF-kappaB to the VCAM-1 promoter. Analyses of the p50 NF-kappaB protein sequence revealed that both serine 20 and serine 227 at the amino terminus of the protein are putative sites for phosphorylation by DNA-PK. Mutation of serine 20 completely eliminated phosphorylation of p50 NF-kappaB by DNA-PK, suggesting that serine 20 is the only site in p50 NF-kappaB for phosphorylation by DNA-PK. Re-establishing wild-type p50 NF-kappaB, but not its serine 20/alanine mutant, in p50 NF-kappaB(-/-) fibroblasts reversed VCAM-1 expression after TNF treatment, demonstrating the importance of the serine 20 phosphorylation site in the induction of VCAM-1 expression. Together, these results elucidate a novel mechanism for the involvement of DNA-PK in the positive regulation of p50 NF-kappaB to drive VCAM-1 expression.
