Specific induction of PAG608 in cranial and spinal motor neurons of L-DOPA-treated parkinsonian rats. 
We identified p53-activated gene 608 (PAG608) as a specifically induced gene in striatal tissue of L-DOPA (100mg/kg)-injected hemi-parkinsonian rats using differential display assay. In the present study, we further examined morphological distribution of PAG608 in the central nervous system of L-DOPA-treated hemi-parkinsonian rats. PAG608 expression was markedly induced in fibers and neuronal cells of the lateral globus pallidus and reticular thalamic nucleus adjacent to internal capsule, specifically in the parkinsonian side of L-DOPA-treated models. The protein was also constitutively expressed in motor neurons specifically in either side of the pontine nucleus and motor nuclei of trigeminal and facial nerves. Furthermore, L-DOPA-induced PAG608 expression on motor neurons in the contralateral side of the ventral horn of the spinal cord and the lateral corticospinal tract without cell loss. The specific induction of PAG608 6-48h after L-DOPA injection in the extrapyramidal tracts, pyramidal tracts and corresponding lower motor neurons of the spinal cords suggests its involvement in molecular events in stimulated motor neurons. Taken together with the constitutive expression of PAG608 in the motor nuclei of cranial nerves, PAG608 may be a useful marker of stressed or activated lower motor neurons.
