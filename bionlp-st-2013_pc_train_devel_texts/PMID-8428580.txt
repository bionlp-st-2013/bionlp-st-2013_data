The NF-kappa B precursor p105 and the proto-oncogene product Bcl-3 are I kappa B molecules and control nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B. 
We have examined the interaction of the NF-kappa B precursor p105 with NF-kappa B subunits. Similar to an I kappa B molecule, p105 associates in the cytoplasm with p50 or p65. Through this assembly, p105 efficiently blocks nuclear transfer of either subunit. Moreover, the p105 protein inhibits DNA binding of dimeric NF-kappa B subunits in a similar, but not identical, manner to its isolated C-terminal domain, which contains an ankyrin-like repeat domain (ARD). The proto-oncogene product Bcl-3 also controls nuclear translocation of p50, but not of p65. Hence, p50 can be retained in the cytoplasm via at least three distinct interactions: through direct interactions either with its own precursor, with Bcl-3 or indirectly through I kappa B alpha or -beta when attached to p65. We discuss a function of p105 as a cytoplasmic assembly unit for homo- and heteromeric NF-kappa B complexes and of Bcl-3 as an I kappa B with novel subunit specificity.
