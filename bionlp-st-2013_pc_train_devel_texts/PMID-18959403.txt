Analysis of chemical shift changes reveals the binding modes of isoindolinone inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction. 
In this study we present a method for defining the binding modes of a set of structurally related isoindolinone inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction. This approach derives the location and orientation of isoindolinone binding, based on an analysis of the patterns of magnitude and direction of chemical shift perturbations for a series of inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction. The MDM2-p53 complex is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in cancer cells with intact tumor suppressor p53, as it offers the possibility of releasing p53 by blocking the MDM2-p53 binding site with a small molecule antagonist to promote apoptosis. Isoindolinones are a novel class of MDM2-antagonists of moderate affinity, which still require the development of more potent candidates for clinical applications. As the applicability of conventional structural methods to this system is limited by a number of fundamental factors, the exploitation of the information contained in chemical shift perturbations has offered a useful route to obtaining structural information to guide the development of more potent compounds. For a set of 12 structurally related isoindolinones, the data suggests 4 different orientations of binding, caused by subtle changes in the chemical structure of the inhibitors.
