Glycoprotein reglucosylation and nucleotide sugar utilization in the secretory pathway: identification of a nucleoside diphosphatase in the endoplasmic reticulum. 
UDP is generated in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a product of the UDP-glucose-dependent glycoprotein reglucosylation in the calnexin/calreticulin cycle. We describe here the identification, purification and characterization of an ER enzyme that hydrolyzes UDP to UMP. This nucleoside diphosphatase is a ubiquitously expressed, soluble 45 kDa glycoprotein devoid of transmembrane domains and KDEL-related ER localization sequences. It requires divalent cations for activity and hydrolyzes UDP, GDP and IDP but not any other nucleoside di-, mono- or triphosphates, nor thiamine pyrophosphate. By eliminating UDP, which is an inhibitory product of the UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, it is likely to promote reglucosylation reactions involved in glycoprotein folding and quality control in the ER.
