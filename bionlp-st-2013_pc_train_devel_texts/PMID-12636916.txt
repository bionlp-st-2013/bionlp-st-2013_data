Phosphorylation-dependent regulation of septin dynamics during the cell cycle. 
Septins are GTPases involved in cytokinesis. In yeast, they form a ring at the cleavage site. Using FRAP, we show that septins are mobile within the ring at bud emergence and telophase and are immobile during S, G2, and M phases. Immobilization of the septins is dependent on both Cla4, a PAK-like kinase, and Gin4, a septin-dependent kinase that can phosphorylate the septin Shs1/Sep7. Induction of septin ring dynamics in telophase is triggered by the translocation of Rts1, a kinetochore-associated regulatory subunit of PP2A phosphatase, to the bud neck and correlates with Rts1-dependent dephosphorylation of Shs1. In rts1-Delta cells, the actomyosin ring contracts properly but cytokinesis fails. Together our results implicate septins in a late step of cytokinesis and indicate that proper regulation of septin dynamics, possibly through the control of their phosphorylation state, is required for the completion of cytokinesis.
