[Study of the effects of quercetin on PML gene and protein expression and localization in leukemia cells]. 
OBJECTIVE: To investigate PML gene and protein expression and localization in leukemia cell lines. METHODS: Cell morphology was assayed by Wright and fluorescence stain, PML mRNA expression by RT-PCR, and PML protein localization by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: (1) Differentiation was observed by morphology in NB4 and HL-60 cells after treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) while K562 cells did not show. Apoptosis was found in each cell line after treatment with quercetin. (2) After treatment with ATRA, the fusion protein disappeared and PML protein resumed in NB4 cells, while in HL-60 and K562 cells there was no difference from control cells. After treatment with quercetin, the fusion protein disappeared in NB4 cells, then degraded, and so did in HL-60 cells and K562 cells. (3) The expression of PML mRNA had no change in all the three cell lines after treatment with ATRA or quercetin. CONCLUSION: PML plays a role of differentiation and apoptosis induction in leukemia cells at the translational level. PML in POD plays a role of apoptosis induction and growth control of leukemia cells.
