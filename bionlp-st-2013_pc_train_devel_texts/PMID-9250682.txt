A novel p53-inducible gene, PAG608, encodes a nuclear zinc finger protein whose overexpression promotes apoptosis. 
The biological effects of the p53 tumor suppressor protein are elicited, at least in part, through sequence-specific transactivation of a battery of target genes. The differential display method was employed towards identifying additional p53 target genes, with emphasis on genes whose induction may contribute to p53-mediated apoptosis. We report here the cloning of a novel p53-inducible gene, designated PAG608. PAG608 transcripts are induced by DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner. PAG608 encodes a nuclear zinc finger protein, which appears to localize preferentially to nucleoli when expressed at moderate levels in transfected cells. Transient overexpression of PAG608 in human tumor-derived cells leads to distinctive changes in nuclear morphology, and can promote apoptosis. Together with additional p53 target genes, PAG608 may therefore play a role in mediating the biological activities of p53.
