Overexpression of Forkhead Box M1 transcription factor and nuclear factor-kappaB in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma: a potential indicator for poor prognosis. 
The Forkhead Box M1 transcription factor and nuclear factor-kappaB have been shown to play important roles in the development and progression of human cancers. However, the functional significance of Forkhead Box M1 transcription factor in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and the correlation between Forkhead Box M1 transcription factor and nuclear factor-kappaB remain unclear. In the current study, we have shown that Forkhead Box M1 transcription factor and nuclear factor-kappaB were significantly overexpressed in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma tissues and precancerous lesions, compared with adjacent normal tissues (both P < .001). The overexpression of Forkhead Box M1 transcription factor was significantly associated with histologic differentiation (rs = 0.321, P = .002), T stage (rs = 0.276, P = .009), lymph node metastasis (rs = 0.266, P = .012), and clinical stage (rs = 0.272, P = .010); overexpression of nuclear factor-kappaB was significantly associated with T stage (rs = 0.404, P < .001), lymph node metastasis (rs = 0.293, P = .005), and clinical stage (rs = 0.425, P < .001). Overexpressions of both Forkhead Box M1 transcription factor and nuclear factor-kappaB were associated with worse overall survival (P = .041 and P < .001, respectively). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that T stage, lymph node metastasis, and nuclear factor-kappaB were independent prognostic factors for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (P = .038, P = .014, and P = .005, respectively). Furthermore, a significant correlation was observed between Forkhead Box M1 transcription factor and nuclear factor-kappaB (rs = 0.683, P < .001), indicating the potential direct or indirect interaction between them. In conclusion, our results suggest that overexpressions of Forkhead Box M1 transcription factor and nuclear factor-kappaB and the possible interaction between them may play important roles in the development and progression of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, and Forkhead Box M1 transcription factor and nuclear factor-kappaB may serve as useful prognostic markers for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
