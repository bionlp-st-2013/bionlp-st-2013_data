NEMO stabilizes c-Myc through direct interaction in the nucleus. 
The transcription factor c-Myc is a cellular oncoprotein generally upregulated in most of human cancers. NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO) caused phosphorylation and stabilization of c-Myc protein in the nucleus through direct interaction. The interaction caused reduced ubiquitination of c-Myc by inhibiting ubiquitinating activity of Fbw7 without blocking the interaction between c-Myc and Fbw7. As a consequence, NEMO enhanced the expression of several selected c-Myc targets. Compared to the classical role as an essential subunit for the activity of IKK complex, stabilization of c-Myc by direct interaction is a unique function of NEMO, representing a new mechanism to regulate c-Myc activity.
