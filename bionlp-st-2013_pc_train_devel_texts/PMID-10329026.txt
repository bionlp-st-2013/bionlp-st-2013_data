Cloning and characterization of retinol dehydrogenase transcripts expressed in human epidermal keratinocytes. 
The normal growth and differentiation of the epidermis require an adequate supply of vitamin A. The active form of vitamin A for normal epidermal homeostasis is retinoic acid (RA). Retinoic acid controls the expression of retinoid-responsive genes via interactions of the retinoic acid/nuclear receptor complexes at specific DNA sequences in their control regions. The message conveyed by RA is likely modulated by the concentration of the ligand available for binding to the receptors. Following the uptake of plasma retinol, epidermal keratinocytes synthesize retinoic acid via two sequential reactions with retinaldehyde as an intermediate. Several retinol dehydrogenase (RDH) enzymes, members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) gene superfamily, catalyze the first and rate-limiting step that generates retinaldehyde from retinol bound to cellular retinol-binding protein (holo-CRBP). However, little is known about these enzymes and their genes in the epidermal cells. Our work describes the first member of the RDH family found in epidermis. We show that this gene is expressed predominantly in the differentiating spinous layers and that it is under positive, feed-forward regulation by retinoic acid. It encodes a protein that, using NAD+ as a preferred cofactor, utilizes free and CRBP-bound all-trans-retinol and steroids as substrates.
