Transactivation of gene expression by Myc is inhibited by mutation at the phosphorylation sites Thr-58 and Ser-62. 
The product of the human c-myc protooncogene (Myc) is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein. Here, we demonstrate that the placement of the specific Myc DNA binding site CACGTG upstream of a luciferase reporter gene conferred Myc-stimulated expression that was inhibited by the overexpression of the basic-helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper protein Max. It was observed that Myc was phosphorylated in vivo within the NH2-terminal domain at Thr-58 and Ser-62. Replacement of these phosphorylation sites with Ala residues caused a marked decrease in Myc-stimulated reporter gene expression. In contrast, the replacement of Thr-58 or Ser-62 with an acidic residue (Glu) caused only a small inhibition of transactivation. Together, these data demonstrate that the NH2-terminal phosphorylation sites Thr-58 and Ser-62 are required for high levels of transactivation of gene expression by Myc.
