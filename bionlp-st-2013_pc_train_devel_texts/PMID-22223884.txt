The p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and PARP1 assist Snail1 in activating fibronectin transcription. 
Snail1 is a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin that triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we report assisted Snail1 interaction with the promoter of a typical mesenchymal gene, fibronectin (FN1), both in epithelial cells undergoing EMT and in fibroblasts. Together with Snail1, the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and PARP1 bound to the FN1 promoter. We detected nuclear interaction of these proteins and demonstrated the requirement of all three for FN1 transcription. Moreover, other genes involved in cell movement mimic FN1 expression induced by Snail1 or TGF-beta1 treatment and recruit p65NF-kappaB and Snail1 to their promoters. The molecular cooperation between Snail1 and NF-kappaB in transcription activation provides a new insight into how Snail1 can modulate a variety of cell programs.
