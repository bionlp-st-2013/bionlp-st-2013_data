Separase, polo kinase, the kinetochore protein Slk19, and Spo12 function in a network that controls Cdc14 localization during early anaphase. 
In budding yeast, the phosphatase Cdc14, a key regulator of exit from mitosis, is released from its inhibitor Cfi1/Net1 in the nucleolus during anaphase. A signaling cascade, known as the mitotic exit network (MEN), controls this release. We have identified a regulatory network, the FEAR (Cdc fourteen early anaphase release) network that promotes Cdc14 release from the nucleolus during early anaphase. The FEAR network is comprised of the polo kinase Cdc5, the separase Esp1, the kinetochore-associated protein Slk19, and Spo12. We also show that the FEAR network initiates Cdc14 release from Cfi1/Net1 during early anaphase, and MEN maintains Cdc14 in the released state during late anaphase. We propose that one function of Cdc14 released by the FEAR network is to stimulate MEN activity.
