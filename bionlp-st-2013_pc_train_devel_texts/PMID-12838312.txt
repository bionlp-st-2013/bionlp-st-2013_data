ICBP90 belongs to a new family of proteins with an expression that is deregulated in cancer cells. 
ICBP90 (Inverted CCAAT box Binding Protein of 90 kDa) is a recently identified nuclear protein that binds to one of the inverted CCAAT boxes of the topoisomerase IIalpha (TopoIIalpha) gene promoter. Here, we show that ICBP90 shares structural homology with several other proteins, including Np95, the human and mouse NIRF, suggesting the emergence of a new family of nuclear proteins. Towards elucidating the functions of this family, we analysed the expression of ICBP90 in various cancer or noncancer cell lines and in normal or breast carcinoma tissues. We found that cancer cell lines express higher levels of ICBP90 and TopoIIalpha than noncancer cell lines. By using cell-cycle phase-blocking drugs, we show that in primary cultured human lung fibroblasts, ICBP90 expression peaks at late G1 and during G2/M phases. In contrast, cancer cell lines such as HeLa, Jurkat and A549 show constant ICBP90 expression throughout the entire cell cycle. The effect of overexpression of E2F-1 is more efficient on ICBP90 and TopoIIalpha expression in noncancer cells (IMR90, WI38) than in cancer cells (U2OS, SaOs). Together, these results show that ICBP90 expression is altered in cancer cell lines and is upregulated by E2F-1 overexpression with an efficiency depending on the cancer status of the cell line.
