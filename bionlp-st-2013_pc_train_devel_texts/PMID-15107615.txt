Inactivating Cdc25, mitotic style. 
Mitotic entry and exit require activation and inactivation of the Cdk1-cyclin B kinase complex, respectively. The Cdc25 protein phosphatase family activates Cdk1-cyclin B at the G2/M transition by removing inhibitory phosphate groups. Cdc25 family members, held inactive during interphase, are activated during mitotic progression in an amplification loop involving Cdk1-cyclin B. While Cdc25 activation at the G2/M transition is required for the timely initiation of mitosis, recent evidence suggests that the inactivation of Cdc25 in late mitosis may play a role in supporting Cdk1-cyclin B inactivation. Here, we discuss the mechanisms of Cdc25 regulation and how they pertain to both mitotic entry and exit.
