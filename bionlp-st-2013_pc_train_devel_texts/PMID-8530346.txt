Human ADP-ribosylation factor-activated phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D defines a new and highly conserved gene family. 
Activation of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D (PLD) has been implicated as a critical step in numerous cellular pathways, including signal transduction, membrane trafficking, and the regulation of mitosis. We report here the identification of the first human PLD cDNA, which defines a new and highly conserved gene family. Characterization of recombinant human PLD1 reveals that it is membrane-associated, selective for phosphatidylcholine, stimulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, activated by the monomeric G-protein ADP-ribosylation factor-1, and inhibited by oleate. PLD1 likely encodes the gene product responsible for the most widely studied endogenous PLD activity.
