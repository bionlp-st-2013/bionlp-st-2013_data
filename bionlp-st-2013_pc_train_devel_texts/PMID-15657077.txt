TRIP6 is a RIP2-associated common signaling component of multiple NF-kappaB activation pathways. 
Receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2) is a member of the RIP kinase family that has been shown to be crucially involved in inflammation, innate and adaptive immune responses. The physiological and pathological roles of RIP2 are mediated through its involvement in multiple NF-kappaB activation pathways, including those triggered by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1 (IL-1), Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR3, TLR4 and Nod1. In this report, we identified the LIM-domain-containing protein TRIP6 as a RIP2-interacting protein in yeast two-hybrid screens. In mammalian cells, TRIP6 interacts with RIP2 in a TNF- or IL-1-dependent manner. Overexpression of TRIP6 potentiates RIP2-mediated NF-kappaB activation in a dose-dependent manner. The LIM domains of TRIP6 are responsible for its interaction with RIP2. TRIP6 also interacts with TRAF2, a protein that is crucially involved in TNF signaling, as well as the IL-1 receptor, TLR2 and Nod1. Overexpression of TRIP6 potentiates NF-kappaB activation by TNF, IL-1, TLR2 or Nod1, whereas a dominant negative mutant or RNA-interference construct of TRIP6 inhibits NF-kappaB activation by TNF, IL-1, TLR2 or Nod1. Moreover, TRIP6 also potentiates RIP2- and Nod1-mediated ERK activation. These data have established a physical and functional association between TRIP6 and RIP2, and suggest that RIP2's involvement in multiple NF-kappaB and ERK activation pathways is mediated through TRIP6.
