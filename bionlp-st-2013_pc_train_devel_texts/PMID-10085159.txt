The Cdc6 protein is ubiquitinated in vivo for proteolysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc6 protein is necessary for the formation of pre-replicative complexes that are required for firing DNA replication at origins at the beginning of S phase. Cdc6p protein levels oscillate during the cell cycle. In a normal cell cycle the presence of this protein is restricted to G1, partly because the CDC6 gene is transcribed only during G1 and partly because the Cdc6p protein is rapidly degraded at late G1/early S phase. We report here that the Cdc6p protein is degraded in a Cdc4-dependent manner, suggesting that phosphorylated Cdc6 is specifically recognized by the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis machinery. Indeed, we have found that Cdc6 is ubiquitinated in vivo and degraded by a Cdc4-dependent mechanism. Our data, together with previous observations regarding Cdc6 stability, suggest that under physiological conditions budding yeast cells degrade ubiquitinated Cdc6 every cell cycle at the beginning of S phase.
