Inhibition of proinflammatory RANTES expression by TGF-beta1 is mediated by glycogen synthase kinase-3beta-dependent beta-catenin signaling. 
TGF-beta1 is a pleiotropic cytokine with potent anti-inflammation property. However, the mechanisms underlying TGF-beta1 suppression of inflammation remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrated that TGF-beta1 inhibited TNF-alpha- or IL-1-induced RANTES expression in human kidney tubular epithelial cells (HKC-8). To delineate the mechanism by which TGF-beta1 inhibits RANTES expression, we examined the potential signal pathway activated by TGF-beta1 in suppressing NF-kappaB signaling. TGF-beta1 affected neither TNF-alpha-induced IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and subsequent degradation, nor p65 NF-kappaB phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation. However, TGF-beta1 could inhibit p65 and p50 binding to the kappaB site in human RANTES promoter as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and protein-DNA binding assay. We found that TGF-beta1 induced glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) phosphorylation on Ser-9 in HKC-8 cells, leading to its inactivation. Knockdown of GSK-3beta mimicked TGF-beta1 and inhibited RANTES induction, whereas overexpression of GSK-3beta abolished the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 and completely restored RANTES expression. Furthermore, TGF-beta1 induced the dephosphorylation and activation of beta-catenin, a major downstream target of GSK-3beta. Ectopic expression of constitutively active beta-catenin mimicked the TGF-beta1 effect and completely suppressed RANTES expression induced by TNF-alpha. Interestingly, TGF-beta1 induced a physical interaction between beta-catenin and p65 NF-kappaB, which prevented p65 binding to the kappaB site, sequestered its trans-activating activity, and repressed p65-mediated gene transcription. We conclude that TGF-beta1 inhibition of proinflammatory RANTES expression is mediated by beta-catenin-triggered blockade of NF-kappaB signaling.
